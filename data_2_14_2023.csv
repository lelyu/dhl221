Rotterdam,"Rotterdam, Netherlands",51.9244,4.4777,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"All the streets are paved with broad stones, and before many of the meanest artificers doors are placed seats of various coloured marbles, so neatly kept, that, I assure you, I walked almost all over the town yesterday, _incognito_, in my slippers without receiving one spot of dirt; and you may see the Dutch maids washing the pavement of the street, with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town seems so full of people, with such busy faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not some celebrated fair; but I see it is every day the same. 'Tis certain no town can be more advantageously situated for commerce. Here are seven large canals, on which the merchants ships come up to the very doors of their houses. The shops and warehouses are of a surprising neatness and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandise, and so much cheaper than what we see in England, that I have much ado to persuade myself I am still so near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be seen. One is not shocked with those loathsome cripples, so common in London, nor teased with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that chuse (sic) to be nasty and lazy. The common servants, and little shop-women, here, are more nicely clean than most of our ladies; and the great variety of neat dresses (every woman dressing her head after her own fashion) is an additional pleasure in seeing the town.

Hague,"The Hague, Netherlands",52.0705,4.3007,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"We take care to make such short stages every day, that I rather fancy myself upon parties of pleasure, than upon the road; and sure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland.  The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, shaded on each side with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats, passing and repassing.  Every twenty paces gives you the prospect of some villa, and every four hours that of a large town, so surprisingly neat, I am sure you would be charmed with them.  The place I am now at is certainly one of the finest villages in the world.  Here are several squares finely built, and (what I think a particular beauty) the whole set with thick large trees.  The _Vour-hout_ is, at the same time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches.  There are shops for wafers, cool liquors, &c.--I have been to see several of the most celebrated gardens, but I will not teaze (sic) you with their descriptions.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Nimeguen,"Nijmegen, Netherlands",51.8449,5.8428,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"If you were with me in this town, you would be ready to expect to receive visits from your Nottingham friends.  No two places were ever more resembling; one has but to give the Maese the name of the Trent, and there is no distinguishing the prospect.  The houses, like those of Nottingham, are built one above another, and are intermixed in the same manner with trees and gardens.  The tower they call Julius Caesar's, has the same situation with Nottingham castle; and I cannot help fancying, I see from it the Trentfield, Adboulton, places so well known to us.  'Tis true, the fortifications make a considerable difference.  All the learned in the art of war bestow great commendations on them; for my part, that know nothing of the matter, I shall content myself with telling you, 'tis a very pretty walk on the ramparts, on  which there is a tower, very deservedly called the Belvidera; where people go to drink coffee, tea, &c. and enjoy one of the finest prospects in the world.  The public walks have no great beauty but the thick shade of the trees, which is solemnly delightful.  But I must not forget to take notice of the bridge, which appeared very surprising to me.  It is large enough to hold hundreds of men, with horses and carriages.  They give the value of an English two-pence to get upon it, and then away they go, bridge and all, to the other side of the river, with so slow a motion, one is hardly sensible of any at all.  I was yesterday at the French church, and stared very much at their manner of service.  The parson clapped on a broad-brimmed hat in the first place, which gave him entirely the air of _what d'ye call him_, in Bartholomew fair, which he kept up by extraordinary antic gestures, and preaching much such stuff as the other talked to the puppets.  However, the congregation seemed to receive it with great devotion; and I was informed by some of his flock, that he is a person of particular fame amongst them.

Cologn,"Cologne, Germany",50.9375,6.9603,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"I slept so well for three hours, that I found myself perfectly recovered, and have had spirits enough to go and see all that is curious in the town, that is to say, the churches, for here is nothing else worth seeing.  This is a very large town, but the most part of it is old built.  The Jesuits church, which is the neatest, was shewed (sic) me, in a very complaisant manner, by a handsome young Jesuit; who, not knowing who I was, took a liberty in his compliments and railleries, which very much diverted me.  Having never before seen any thing of that nature, I could not enough admire the magnificence of the altars, the rich images of the saints (all massy silver) and the _enchassures_ of the relicks (sic); though I could not help murmuring, in my heart, at the profusion of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, bestowed on the adornment of rotten teeth, and dirty rags.  I own that I had wickedness enough to covet St Ursula's pearl necklaces; though perhaps this was no wickedness at all, an image not being certainly one's neighbour's; but I went yet farther, and wished the wench herself converted into dressing-plate.  I should also gladly see converted into silver, a great St Christopher, which I imagine would look very well in a cistern.

'Tis impossible not to observe the difference between the free towns and those under the government of absolute princes, as all the little sovereigns of Germany are.  In the first, there appears an air of commerce and plenty.  The streets are well-built, and full of people, neatly and plainly dressed.  The shops are loaded with merchandise, and the commonalty are clean and cheerful.  In the other you see a sort of shabby finery, a number of dirty people of quality tawdered (sic) out; narrow nasty streets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common sort asking alms.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Vienna,"Vienna, Austria",48.2082,16.3738,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"This town, which has the honour of being the emperor's residence, did not at all answer my expectation, nor ideas of it, being much less than I expected to find it; the streets are very close, and so narrow, one cannot observe the fine fronts of the palaces, though many of them very well deserve observation, being truly magnificent.  They are built of fine white stone, and are excessive high.  For as the town is too little for the number of the people that desire to live in it, the builders seem to have projected to repair that misfortune, by clapping one town on the top of another, most of the houses being of five, and some of them six stories.  You may easily imagine, that the streets being so narrow, the rooms are extremely dark; and, what is an inconveniency much more intolerable, in my opinion, there is no house has so few as five or six families in it.  The apartments of the greatest ladies, and even of the ministers of state, are divided, but by a partition, from that of a taylor (sic) or shoemaker; and I know no body that has above two floors in any house, one for their own use, and one higher for their servants.  Those that have houses of their own, let Out the rest of them to whoever will take them; and thus the great stairs, (which are all of stone) are as common and as dirty as the street.  'Tis true, when you have once travelled through them, nothing can be more surprisingly magnificent than the apartments.  They are commonly a _suite_ of eight or ten large rooms, all inlaid, the doors and windows richly carved and gilt, and the furniture, such as is seldom seen in the palaces of sovereign princes in other countries.  Their apartments are adorned with hangings of the finest tapestry of Brussels, prodigious large looking glasses in silver frames, fine japan tables, beds, chairs, canopies, and window curtains of the richest Genoa damask or velvet, almost covered with gold lace or embroidery.  All this is made gay by pictures, and vast jars of japan china, and large lustres of rock crystal.

If the emperor found it proper to permit the gates of the town to be laid open, that the Fauxburg might be joined to it, he would have one of the largest and best built cities in Europe.  Count Schoonbourn's villa is one of the most magnificent; the furniture all rich brocades, so well fancied and fitted up, nothing can look more gay and splendid; not to speak of a gallery, full of rarities of coral, mother of pearl, and, throughout the whole house, a profusion of gilding, carving, fine paintings, the most beautiful porcelain, statues of alabaster and ivory, and vast orange and lemon trees in gilt pots.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

There are yet some remains of its former splendour, being one of the largest towns in Germany, but, for the most part, old built, and thinly inhabited, which makes the houses very cheap.

After passing these dreadful rocks, Dresden appeared to me a wonderfully agreeable situation, in a fine large plain on the banks of the Elbe.  I was very glad to stay there a day to rest myself.

Leipzig, where I am at present, is a town very considerable for its trade, and I take this opportunity of buying pages liveries, gold stuffs for myself, &c. all things of that kind being at least double the price at Vienna; partly because of the excessive customs, and partly through want of genius and industry in the people, who make no one sort of thing there; so that the ladies are obliged to send, even for their shoes, out of Saxony.  The fair here is one of the most considerable in Germany, and the resort of all the people of quality, as well as of the merchants.

Hanover,"
Hanover, Germany",52.3759,9.732,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1716,"You will not forgive me, if I do not say something of Hanover; I cannot tell you that the town is either large or magnificent.  The opera house, which was built by the late elector, is much finer than that of Vienna.  I was very sorry that the ill weather did not permit me to see Hernhausen in all its beauty; but in spite of the snow, I thought the gardens very fine.  I was particularly surprised at the vast number of orange trees, much larger than any I have ever seen in England, though this climate is certainly colder.  But I had more reason to wonder that night at the king's table, to see a present from a gentleman of this country, of two large baskets full of ripe oranges and lemons of different sorts, many of which were quite new to me; and what I thought worth all the rest, two ripe ananasses (sic), which, to my taste, are a fruit perfectly delicious.  You know they are naturally the growth of Brazil, and I could not imagine how they came here, but by enchantment.  Upon inquiry, I learnt that they have brought their stoves to such perfection, they lengthen their summer as long as they please, giving to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the sun in its native soil.  The effect is very near the same; I am surprised we do not practise (sic) in England so useful an invention.  This reflection leads me to consider our obstinacy in shaking with cold, five months in the year rather than make use of stoves, which are certainly one of the greatest conveniencies (sic) of life.  Besides, they are so far from spoiling the form of a room, that they add very much to the magnificence of it, when they are painted and gilt, as they are at Vienna, or at Dresden, where they are often in the shapes of china jars, statues, or fine cabinets, so naturally represented, that they are not to be distinguished.

It has its name from the River Rab, on which it is situated, just on its meeting with the Danube, in an open champaign (sic) country.  It was first taken by the Turks, under the command of bassa Sinan, in the reign of sultan Amurath III. in the year fifteen hundred and ninety-four.  The governor, being supposed to have betrayed it, was afterwards beheaded by the emperor's command.  The counts of Swartzenburg; and Palsi retook it by surprise, 1598; since which time it has remained in the hands of the Germans, though the Turks once more attempted to gain it by stratagem in 1642.

Buda,"Budapest, Hungary",47.4979,19.0402,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1717,"We continued two days travelling between this place and Buda, through the finest plains in the world, as even as if they were paved, and extremely fruitful; but for the most part desert and uncultivated, laid waste by the long wars between the Turk and the Emperor; and the more cruel civil war, occasioned by the barbarous persecution of the protestant religion by the emperor Leopold.  That prince has left behind him the character of an extraordinary piety, and was naturally of a mild merciful temper; but, putting his conscience into the hands of a Jesuit, he was more cruel and treacherous to his poor Hungarian subjects, than ever the Turk has been to the Christians; breaking, without scruple his coronation oath, and his faith, solemnly given in many public treaties.  Indeed, nothing can be more melancholy than in travelling through Hungary, to reflect on the former flourishing state of that kingdom, and to see such a noble spot of earth almost uninhabited. Such are also the present circumstances of Buda (where we arrived very early the twenty-second) once the royal seat of the Hungarian kings, whose palace was reckoned one of the most beautiful buildings of the age, now wholly destroyed, no part of the town having been repaired since the last siege, but the fortifications and the castle, which is the present residence of the governor general Ragule, an officer of great merit.  He came immediately to see us, and carried us in his coach to his house, where I was received by his lady with all possible civility, and magnificently entertained.  This city is situated upon a little hill on the south side of the Danube.  The castle is much higher than the town, and from it the prospect is very noble.  Without the walls ly (sic) a vast number of little houses, or rather huts, that they call the Rascian town, being altogether inhabited by that people.  The governor assured me, it would furnish twelve thousand fighting men.  These towns look very odd; their houses stand in rows, many thousands of them so close together, that they appear, at a little distance, like old-fashioned thatched tents. They consist, every one of them, of one hovel above, and another under ground; these are their summer and winter apartments.  Buda was first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, in 1526, and lost the following year to Ferdinand I, king of Bohemia.  Solyman regained it by the treachery of the garrison, and voluntarily gave it into the hands of king John of Hungary; after whose death, his son being an infant, Ferdinand laid siege to it, and the queen mother was forced to call Solyman to her aid.  He indeed raised the siege, but left a Turkish garrison in the town, and commanded her to remove her court from thence, which she was forced to submit to, in 1541.  It resisted afterwards the sieges laid to it by the marquis of Brandenburg, in the year 1542; count Schwartzenburg, in 1598; General Rosworm, in 1602; and the duke of Lorrain, commander of the emperor's forces, in 1684, to whom it yielded, in 1686, after an obstinate defence, Apti Bassa, the governor, being killed, fighting in the breach with a Roman bravery.  The loss of this town was so important, and so much resented by the Turks, that it occasioned the deposing of their emperor Mahomet IV. the year following.

The few people that inhabit Hungary, live easily enough; they have no money, but the woods and plains afford them provision in great abundance; they were ordered to give us all things necessary, even what horses we pleased to demand, _gratis_; but Mr W----y would not oppress the poor country people, by making use of this order, and always paid them to the full worth of what we had.

The bridge was esteemed one of the most extraordinary in the world, being eight thousand paces long, and all built of oak.  It was burnt, and the city laid in ashes by count Lesly, 1685, but was again repaired and fortified by the Turks, who, however, abandoned it in 1687.

It is now fortified with the utmost care and skill the Turks are capable of, and strengthened by a very numerous garrison of their bravest janizaries, commanded by a bassa seraskier (i.e. general) though this last expression is not very just; for, to say truth, the seraskier is commanded by the janizaries.

Sophia,"Sophia, Bulgaria",42.6977,23.3219,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1717,"IN one of these covered waggons, I went to the bagnio about ten o'clock. It was already full of women. It is built of stone, in the shape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of these domes joined together, the outmost being less than the rest, and serving only as a hall, where the portress stood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten shillings; and I did not forget that ceremony. The next room is a very large one paved with marble, and all round it are two raised sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling first into marble basons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpose, which carried the streams into the next room, something less than this, with the same sort of marble sofas, but so hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impossible to stay there with one's cloathson. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers pleased to have.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

The summer is already far advanced in this part of the world; and, for some miles round Adrianople, the whole ground is laid out in gardens, and the banks of the rivers are set with rows of fruit-trees, under which all the most considerable Turks divert themselves every evening, not with walking, that is not one of their pleasures; but a set party of them chuse out a green spot, where the shade is very thick, and, there they spread a carpet, on which they sit drinking their coffee, and are generally attended by some slave with a fine voice, or that plays on some instrument.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

It is now very full of people; but they are most of them such as follow the court, or camp; and when they are removed, I am told, 'tis no populous city. The river Maritza (anciently the Hebrus) on which it is situated, is dried up every summer, which contributes very much to make it unwholesome. It is now a very pleasant stream. There are two noble bridges built over it. ... But the pavement is kept much neater; and the shops are all so clean, they seem just new painted. ... This copious subject has drawn me from my description of the exchange, founded by Ali Bassa, whose name it bears. Near it is the sherski, a street of a mile in length, full of shops of all kind of fine merchandise, but excessive dear, nothing being made here.

Our palace is in Pera, which is no more a suburb of Constantinople, than Westminster is a suburb to London. All the ambassadors are lodged very near each other. One part of our house shews us the port, the city, and the seraglio, and the distant hills of Asia; perhaps, all together, the most beautiful prospect in the world.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

It is on a point of land running into the sea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregular. The gardens take in a large compass of ground, full of high cypress-trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white stone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and spires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Christian-king's palace half so large. There are six large courts in it, all built round, and set with trees, having galleries of stone; one of these for the guard, another for the slaves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the stables, the fifth for the divan, and the sixth for the apartment destined for audiences.

My curiosity supplied me with strength to climb to the top of it, to see the place where Achilles was buried, and where Alexander ran naked round his tomb, in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great comfort to his ghost. I saw there the ruins of a very large city, and found a stone, on which Mr W——y plainly distinguished the words of Sigaen Polin. ... WE saw very plainly from this promontory, the river Simois rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very spacious valley. It is now a considerable river, and is called Simores, it is joined in the vale by the Scamander, which appeared a small stream half choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was Xanthus amongst the gods, as Homer tells us; and 'tis by that heavenly name, the nymph Oenone invokes it, in her epistle to Paris. The Trojan virgins used to offer their first favours to it, by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which Monsieur de la Fontaine has told so agreeably, abolish'd that heathenish ceremony. When the stream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the sea.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the English men of war came into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging myself, and I went often on shore. When the ships were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water I ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on board our ship to dine.

I had often heard of some wonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some white and black people to visit it.

Leaving St. Tubes ascending towards Convent of Palmella,"Palmalla, Portugal",38.56501,-8.9008,Janet Schaw,1775,"As we advanced nearer the summit, we left behind St Tubes, the sea, the shipping, the large salt-works, the fine ruins, and a country beautifully green with corn and rich pasture-ground. Before us we had the river, Tagus, with the 
town of Lisbon and all the adjacent country on the opposite shore. On our left hand we had a scene nobly wild and beau-tifully romantick. The mountains presented us with rocks and woods, thro' which flowed many a rapid stream, which fell down in noisy cascades thro' the valleys below. But tho' these valleys boasted their cultivation and invited us to admire vine-yards, orange-groves and olive orchards, yet that where Nature alone held dominion entirely engaged our attention, and we traced the wildness of the mountains, as far as our eyes could penetrate thro' the trees or over the rocks.","Janet Schaw, Journal of a Lady of Quality; Being the Narrative of a Journey from Scotland to the West Indies,  North Carolina, and Portugal, in the Years 1774 to 1776, ed.

"Cape Fear River, North Carolina","Cape Fear River, North Carolina",34.1869,-77.96357,Alexander Schaw,1775,"IN the province of North Carolina there are several rivers, which run a considerable way into the country. Upon the south is Cape Fear river, which is navigable for ships of large burden as far as a shoal which they call the Flats, about seven miles above Brunswick town, which is situated twelve miles within the bar. In consequence of this impediment, vessels which have a draught of above nine and a half feet of water cannot go up to Wilmington, which is the next port above and the most considerable town on the river, even at spring tides, till they are lightened to that draught. Above, or rather at Wil- mington, the Northeast and Northwest branches of the river join. The Northwest is the least considerable, and upon the whole extent there is no town, tho' its banks are very well settled. The first town is Cross Creek, about 100 miles above Wilmington. Here the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on for a great way round.

From Brunswick to Wilmington there are two roads: one goes up the right side of the river upon which Brunswick stands and crosses two ferries opposite to Wilmington, occasioned by the river being there divided by a large swampy island, through which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half. The length of this road is reckoned sixteen miles. To go by the other road, one must cross a ferry at Brunswick of a mile over, from whence to Wilming-ton it is about ten miles. Every part of these roads is more or less sandy. Some of them for miles together is very deep, as the surface often is a pure white sand, without a particle of soil to bind it together. This is the case with almost every part of the province near the sea.","Janet Schaw, Journal of a Lady of Quality; Being the Narrative of a Journey from Scotland to the West Indies,  North Carolina, and Portugal, in the Years 1774 to 1776, ed.

Wherever the land is dry, there is little or no brush. The woods in general are in the style of open groves in England, except in such places as have once been cleared and afterwards abandoned. These are always covered with brush. The roads upon the Northwest branch of the river grow more solid every mile above Wilmington, and long before they reach Cross Creek are very hard. The only making they bestow upon the roads in the flat part of the country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth, in as even a line as they can, and where the ground is wet, they make a small ditch on either side. The roads through swamp land are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them cross ways with small pine trees, layd regularly together over sod, with which the logs are previously covered.

It is a regular Octogon with eight Stories, each ol eleven Foot at least, besides the first, which exceeds fifteen without the Coping, so that the whole Height is 100 Foot. This Tower is all of Brick as white as Stone, and well built ; it is embellish’d with several Ornaments of Brick-Work, and a fort of Plaister laid thereon. Its Architecture is quite different from ours, and tho' a little rude, has its Beauty, and pleases the Eye : The first Story is round, and shaped like a Cup, adorn-ed with Foliages ; the rest have eight Fronts, in each of which are two Statues in Demi -Relief, near as big as the Life, but ill done. You go up to the first Story by a Ladder, and there the Staircafe begins. Here probably stood a City, or large Town, for there still remains a wide Compass of Mud Walls, which, tho’ more than half demolish’d, are entire enough to shew that the Tower was built by the Western Tartars , whilst they reign’d in China , under the Family of the Ywen.","J.-B.

It afterwards fell into the hands of the Genoese, and when Timúr laid waste the towns of Dadián, Heshdek, and other towns amounting altogether to the number of seven hundred, in his expedition against Tokhatmish the Lord of Crimea, he also wasted the suburbs of the castle of Anapa, but the castle itself was spared. In the reign of Sultán Bayazíd II., the great Vezír Gedek Ahmed Páshá, leading the expedition against Kaffa, took this castle also from the Genoese, and put troops into it. It is situated at the extremity of the Cape which divides the territory of the Abáza from Circassia, on a clay cliff; it is a strong castle without a garrison, and has been several times ransacked by the Cossacks of the Tanais.

To the right and left of the mountain are many wells in the rocks. The rocks being perpendicular like those of Mount Bisútún are excavated at the base. The projecting rocks are so lofty that ships with topmasts an hundred yards high may enter here, and come to an anchor. The masters of these ships take in barley and wheat which is brought in waggons to the mouths of the aforesaid shafts which are cut in the rock, and poured down them into the holds; these shafts were cut in ancient times by Infidel stonecutters, who were like so many Ferháds; and it is a peculiar sight not to be seen elsewhere, and saves a circuit of between three and four hours in bringing the barley to the foot of the rock. There are no such high and dreary rocks any where in the Black Sea. During southernly and easternly gales, the sea produces a roaring in the excavations, which is heard as far as Iflatár and Ilhánlar near Silistra, a day’s journey from hence.

Its depth is twenty fathoms, the water is clear and brilliant, and excellent for washing without soap. It is this water which gives a whiteness resembling cotton to the bread Súmúní. On the east side of the lake, at two hours distance, passes the river Sakaria, which disembogues into the Black Sea in the province of Koja Ilí at the place called Irva; it would require but little spirit of enterprise to unite the lake with the sea, by means of this river, a branch of which goes down to the salt-marshes of Nicomedia. As early as the reign of Mohammed III. a great number of workmen were employed in establishing a communication between the gulf of Nicomedia and the lake of Sabánja, but the undertaking was given up at the request of the inhabitants. If the Sakaria were united with this lake, and the lake with the gulf of Nicomedia, this town would be quite an inland port; the timber and wood might be brought down to Bolí, and it would cost no more than five aspers the quintal.

The Muderris (Professors) hold them in the mosques, the students (Thelebe) are numerous. The suburb outside of the castle is well built, and its baths pleasant, but the bath inside the castle is very small; the best is that outside the eastern gate of the castle, the waiters are fine Georgian boys; there are a great number of kháns; no vineyards (Bágh), but in some places gardens (Bághje); a large number of gardens of fruit trees (Mushebek-bostán) full of valuable trees, well watered by springs. The water of this place comes from the mountains of Uda, waters the fields of the town, goes straight to the castle of Arghán, and falls near the Castle of Kúrehkt into the Araxes.

Watchmen keep watch the whole night, lighting torches and lamps. The lower castle is surrounded by a lake instead of a ditch, which encircles it from the middle gate to the gate of Behrám-páshá, and hence it is impossible to get possession of the fortress.

Dublin,Dublin,53.3498,-6.2603,Burton E. Stevenson,1910,"I no longer think of it as a gay town—rather as a supremely tragic one. Turn the corner from any of the main thoroughfares, and you will soon find yourself in a foul alley of crowded tenements, in the midst of a misery and squalor that wring the heart. You will wonder to see women laughing together and children playing on the damp pavements. It is thin laughter and half-hearted play; and yet, even here, there is a certain air of carelessness and good-humour. It may be that these miserable people do not realise their misery. Cleanliness is perhaps as painful to a person reared in dirt as dirt is to a person reared in cleanliness; slum dwellers, I suppose, do not notice the slum odour; a few decades of slum life must inevitably destroy or, at least, deaden those niceties of smell and taste and feeling which play so large a part in the lives of the well-to-do. And it is fortunate that this is so. But one threads one's way along these squalid streets, shuddering at thought of the vice and disease that must be bred there, and mourning, not so much for their unfortunate inhabitants, as for the blindness and inefficiency of the social order which permits them to exist.","Burton E.

Drogheda itself is an up-and-down place, built on the side of a hill. I suppose the castle which was the nucleus of the town stood on top of the hill, and houses were gradually built from it down to the ford from which the town takes its name. Encircled with walls and dominated by its castle, it was no doubt picturesque enough, but it is singularly dingy and unattractive now, with slums almost as bad as Dublin's and evidences of biting poverty everywhere.","Burton E.

Cormac McCarthy built it in the fifteenth century as a defence against the English, and it was held by the Irish until Cromwell's army besieged and captured it. Around the top of the tower is a series of machicolations, or openings between supporting corbels, through which the besieged, in the old days, could drop stones and[117] pour molten lead and red-hot ashes and such-like things down upon the assailants, and it is in the sill of one of these openings that the famous Blarney stone is fixed.","Burton E.

I picked up somewhere, perhaps from the jargon of the guide, that this wishing-stone is the altar of Fin Barre's old chapel, but I haven't been able to verify this, and it may not be so; but the game is to put up a prayer to the Saint, and make your wish, and leave some token to show you are in earnest, and the wish will surely come true.

It is not very old, as Irish ruins go, for it dates only from the latter half of the fifteenth century, when it was founded for the Franciscans. The gem of the place is undoubtedly the cloister, with its arcade of graceful arches ranged around a court and lighting a finely-vaulted ambulatory. In the middle of the court is a giant yew, many centuries old, which spreads its branches from wall to wall. It is encircled with barbed wire, and I don't know whether this is to protect it from vandals, or to protect vandals from it—for the legend is that whoever plucks a spray of this tree dies within a twelvemonth.","Burton E.

All the people hereabouts, she added, lived by the turf cutting, at which they could earn, perhaps, ten-pence a day; but in bad seasons they were soon close to starvation. I remarked that, with such wages, they must be close to it all the time, and she[268] smiled sadly and said that that was true. Only, of course, in the bogs the children can work, as well as the men and women, and that helps. Indeed, we saw them many times—little boys and girls who should have been at school or running free, gaining health and strength for the hard years to come, tugging at the heavy, water-soaked blocks of peat, and laying them out in the sun to dry.

All the women here in Galway were shawled, and beautiful shawls they were, of a delicate fawn-colour, and very soft and thick… A few had carts drawn by little grey donkeys; and the old woman in one of these was so typical that I wanted to get her picture.

Such hotels as those at Bundoran, Recess and Parknasilla—and there are many others like them, handsome buildings, splendidly equipped, set in the midst of beautiful surroundings—leave nothing to be desired. Nor are their rates excessive, considering the excellent service they offer, averaging a little over three dollars a day. In the smaller towns, the tariff is considerably less than this, though the service is almost as good. In places where the railroad does not itself own or manage a hotel, it usually sees to it that at least one under private management is kept up to a satisfactory standard.

Two or three miles along country roads brought us to a gate; and here our driver, looking a little anxious, had a short conference with a woman who lived in a neat labourer's cottage near by; and finally he opened the gate and drove through.","Burton E.

The visitor, expecting to see something magnificent and grandiose, is rather dashed at first to find how small it is; but after a few minutes' wandering over the queer columns of basalt, this feeling passes, and one begins to realise that it is really one of the wonders of the world. I am not going to describe it—every one has seen photographs of it, or if any one hasn't, he will find some opposite this page; and the photographs picture it much better than I can. There are some forty thousand of the pillars, the guide-book says; five-sided or six-sided for the most part, averaging, I should say, about fifteen inches in diameter, and so close together that a lead pencil is too thick to be thrust between them. The pillars are divided into regular, worm-like segments, some six or eight inches thick, and there are quite a lot of segments lying about, broken off from the columns. The whole bed is said by geologists to be nothing but a lava-flow, which broke up into these columnar shapes when it cooled and contracted.","Burton E.

My own guess would be that these weather-beaten stones, like those others on the hill beside Lough Gill, antedate Ossian by at least two thousand years. But that is an unimportant detail; and it may be, indeed, that when the great singer died, his comrades could think of no more fitting place to lay him than within the guardian circle of this monument of an older race, looking down across the valley and out toward the sea.","Burton E.

His references to King Billy and the Boyne and the walls of Derry were many and frequent, and he had all sorts of newspaper clippings in his pockets, from which he read freely, and though he was very hoarse and bathed in perspiration, he showed no sign of stopping. He intimated that, once Home Rule was established, the revival of the inquisition would be but a matter of a short time, that no Protestant would be allowed to own property, that no Protestant labourer could expect employment anywhere until he had abjured his religion, that their children would be taken away from them and reared in Catholic schools, and he called upon them to arm and stand firm, to offer their lives upon the altar of their country, and not retreat a step before the aggressions of the Scarlet Woman.

The disrobing is done in the outer chamber, which has a low stone bench running around three sides, and then the penitent enters a small inner chamber, descends some six or seven steps into the pool of water, and, I suppose, places himself below the stream which falls into the pool from the end of a pipe. As its name indicates, this well was supposed to have the power of washing away all disease, both physical and moral, and time was when it was very popular. The effect of the cold bath was so exhilarating, and the sudden sense of freedom from sin and disease so uplifting, that the penitents would sometimes rush forth to proclaim their blessed state without pausing to resume their garments. Naturally a lot of impious Orangemen would gather to see the fun; and finally both the secular authorities and the Catholic clergy set their faces against the practices, with the result that they gradually fell into disuse. Only single pilgrims, or small companies, at most, come now to bathe in the magic waters, and their behaviour is most circumspect. The cells, themselves, are well-nigh in ruins. A chapel to Saint Patrick, from whom these waters derive their efficacy, was begun during the day of their popularity, but was never finished, and now only a fragment of it remains.","Burton E.

There, for a moment, his troops fell into disorder before the fierce attack of the Irish, and as he tried to rally them, a band of Irish horse rushed upon him, circled round him and left him dead upon the ground. Almost at the same moment, the white-haired Walker, who had exhorted the defenders of Derry never to surrender, was shot dead while urging on the men of Ulster. But though the Irish were able to hold their ground at first, and even to drive their assailants back into the river, a long flanking movement which William had set on foot earlier in the day, caught them unprepared, and they gave way, at last, before superior numbers and superior discipline.","Burton E.

Monasterboice it is called—Mainister Buithe, the abbey of Boetius—and the way thither lies along a pleasant road, through a wooded valley—which, fertile as it is, is not without its traces of desolation, for we passed more than one vast empty mill, falling to decay. Then, on the slope of a hillside away ahead, we saw the round tower, or what is left of it, for the top of it is broken off, struck by lightning, perhaps. But the fragment that remains is 110 feet high! And seeing it thus, across the valley, with the low little church nestling at its base, one is inclined to think that Father Dempsey was not altogether wrong when he said he cared nothing about the theories of antiquarians concerning the round towers, for he knew what they were—the forefingers of the early church pointing us all to God.","Burton E.

The shaft, which is about two feet square and eighteen feet high, is divided into seven compartments on either face, and in each of them is an elaborately-sculptured representation of some Bible scene, usually with three figures. Although much worn, it is still possible easily to decipher some of them, for there is Eve accepting the apple from the serpent while Adam looks mildly on, and here they are fleeing from Paradise before the angel with the flaming sword, and next Cain is hitting Abel on the head with a club while a third unidentified person watches the scene without offering to interfere. At the crossing there is a splendid crucifixion, with the usual crowded heaven and hell to left and right; the binding circle is beautifully ornamented with an interlacing design; and the cap-stone represents one of those high-pitched cells or churches, such as we saw at Killaloe and Glendalough.","Burton E.

"The Rock of Cashel, Tipperary","The Rock of Cashel, Tipperary",52.5201,-7.8905,William Eleroy Curtis,1908,"Cashel, at present a miserable, deserted village, was once the rich and proud capital of Munster. Adjoining the ruins of the cathedral is the ancient and weather-worn “Cross of Cashel,” which was raised upon a rude pedestal, where the kings of Munster were formerly crowned. The ruins are more extensive than anywhere else in Ireland, for Cashel at one time was the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland and its greatest educational centre. Here the Pope’s legates resided and here Henry II., in 1172, received the homage of the Irish kings. But what gives the place its greatest sanctity is the fact that St. Patrick spent much time there and held there the first synod that ever assembled in Ireland, about the middle of the fifth century. That is supposed to have been the reason for the erection of so many sacred edifices and monasteries in early days. St. Declan lived there, too, and commemorated his conversion to Christianity by the erection of one of the churches. Donald O’Brien, King of Limerick, erected another, and his son Donough founded an abbey in 1182. Holy Cross, beautifully situated in a thick grove on the banks of the River Suir, was built in 1182 for the Cistercian order of monks. It derived its name because a piece of the true cross, set with precious stones and presented to a grandson of Brian Boru by Pope Pascal II., was kept there for centuries, and made the abbey the object of pilgrimages of the faithful from all parts of Ireland. This precious relic is now in the Ursuline convent at Cork.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909), 9-10.",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43921,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe
"St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin","St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin",53.3395,-6.2715,William Eleroy Curtis,1908,"St. Patrick’s Cathedral is, perhaps, the most notable building in Ireland, and one of the oldest. During the religious wars and the clashes of the clans in the early history of Ireland it was the scene and the cause of much contention and violence. Its sacred walls were originally arranged as fortifications to defend it against the savage tribes and to protect the dignitaries of the church, who resided behind embattled gates for centuries. At one time St. Patrick’s was used as a barrack for soldiers, and the verger will show you an enormous baptismal font, from which he says the dragoons used to water their horses, and the interior was fitted up for courts of law. Henry VIII. confiscated the property and revenues because the members of its chapter refused to accept the new doctrines, and nearly all of them were banished from Ireland. He abolished a small university that was attached to the cathedral by the pope in 1320 for the education of priests. For five hundred years there was a continuous quarrel between St. Patrick’s and Christ Church Cathedral, which stands only two blocks away, because of rivalries over ecclesiastical privileges, powers, and revenues. Finally a compromise was reached, under which there has since been peace between the two great churches and relations similar to those of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s in London. Christ Church is the headquarters of the episcopal see of Dublin, and St. Patrick’s is regarded as a national church. The chief reason why St. Patrick’s has such a hold upon the affections and reverence of the people is because it stands upon the site of a small wooden church erected by St. Patrick himself in the year 450 and within a few feet of a sacred spring or well at which he baptized thousands of pagans during his ministry. The exact site of the well was identified in 1901 by the discovery of an ancient Celtic cross buried in the earth a few feet from the tower of the cathedral. The cross is now exhibited in the north aisle. The floor of the church is only seven feet above the waters of a subterranean brook called the Poddle, and during the spring floods is often inundated, but in the minds of the founders the sanctity of the spot compensated for the insecure foundations.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909), 15-6.",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43922,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe

In 1172 Strongbow, the Welch Earl of Pembroke, leader of the Norman invasion, swept away the original building to make room for the present edifice, which was fifty years in building. The present nave, transepts, and crypt are those that Strongbow erected, having been thoroughly repaired and restored by Henry Roe, a wealthy distiller, at a cost of £220,000, between 1870 and 1878. In 1178 Strongbow died of a malignant ulcer of the foot, which his enemies attributed to the vengeance of the early Irish saints whose shrines he had violated, and he is buried within the church he built. His black marble tomb is on the south side, with a recumbent effigy in chain armor lying upon the sarcophagus. A smaller effigy in black marble, representing the upper half of a human form, lies beside him and is said to mark the tomb of Strongbow’s son, whom his father literally cut in half with his mighty sword for showing cowardice in battle. Sir Henry Sidney, who discussed the question at length in 1571, declares that there is no doubt that the remains of Strongbow were deposited here, but there is another tomb, with a similar effigy of one-half of his son lying beside it, in an ancient church at Waterford, where Strongbow dwelt in a castle and made his headquarters. The claims of the Waterford tomb are considered much stronger than those of Christ Church in Dublin, because that was where he died and where his wife and family lived after him.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909), 32-3.",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43923,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe

Courts were established, and an imposing building called “The Four Courts” was erected to accommodate the four divisions of the judiciary,—chancery, king’s bench, exchequer, and common pleas. In early times each term of court was opened by a religious service, when the choir of Christ Church would sing an anthem and the dean would offer prayer. One of the boundaries of the Four Courts was a dark, narrow passage, which a wit, struck with its gloom, nicknamed “Hell,” and carried out his idea by erecting at the entrance a fantastic figure supposed to represent the evil one.

It looks more like the dormitory of an ancient university or a hospital or military barracks, although there are two ancient towers in which many men have been imprisoned and in which several patriots have died, and the south side of the pile, which overlooks a beautiful lawn in the very center of Dublin, has quite the appearance of a fortress. It has been the scene of much bloody history, much treachery and cruelty, and many deeds of valor have been done in the two courtyards. One of the viceroys of the sixteenth century, in a letter to the King of England describing its partial destruction by fire, wrote that he had “lost nothing but a few barrels of powder and the worst castle in the worst situation in Christendom”. The tower has not been used as a prison since 1798 and 1803, the rebellions of Emmet and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and the documents relating to their conspiracy are preserved there in the very cells where the men who were convicted by them lay awaiting trial and execution. The late Mr. Lecky, the historian, searched them thoroughly, and gave a surprising account of the character of the private papers that were seized with the effects of the patriots in those days. Love letters, poems, reflections on various subjects, rules of conduct, maxims of the sages, drafts of speeches, and proclamations in soaring language, and many attempts at literary work are mixed up with the reports of spies, informers, detectives, and officials,—some of them from comrades whose treachery was never suspected and which Mr. Lecky was not permitted to publish even at this late day. Some people think these malicious and incriminating documents should be destroyed lest they may sometime come to light and ruin the reputation of men who are highly esteemed by their fellow countrymen.

The turf is well kept, and here and there are memorial wreaths preserved under glass globes. In the center of the circle is a high mound, protected by a hedge of arbor vitæ, and ornamented by several rose bushes. The grave is in the center of the mound. At the head is an iron cross six feet high, and at the foot the name “Parnell” is worked out in large letters of box. One of the employees of the cemetery, who showed us around, said that it was the intention of Parnell’s friends to erect a monument to correspond with that of Daniel O’Connell on the other side of the chapel, but after a discussion of several years they had decided to place the memorial downtown at the site I have already mentioned, where it would always be before the eyes of the public. O’Connell’s body is buried in a crypt underneath the monument. His heart is in a casket in the chapel of the Irish College at Rome.

All they had to do was to enter the examinations and fulfill the requirements. But two years ago this practice was stopped, and now no degrees are conferred upon young women who do not take the full course at Trinity. The fees are the same as for men—$50. The women students are mostly Irish, although a few English girls, who are not satisfied with the certificates given them at Cambridge and Oxford, come over here from Girton and other institutions and work for the full degrees of B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and even for diplomas in law and medicine.

Nearly every winter’s gale sent a ship or two to destruction, and the bodies of hundreds of poor seamen have been washed up where the children are now playing in the sand. Here and there the skeletons of dead vessels may yet be seen, but the North Bull is no longer dangerous. Modern devices protect navigation, and in the midst of the heather and the glowing yellow gorse golf links have been laid out and a clubhouse has been erected, surrounded by lilacs, laburnums, and hawthorns, now in the full glory of their bloom.

The name was taken from similar towers in Corsica and Sardinia, where they were erected for protection against pirates in the time of Charles V.

That was the fashion in those days when people were not so particular about the rights of others as at present. In this highly moral and righteous generation there’s a court sitting regularly to hear any complaints that a tenant may wish to make concerning the rent exacted for his farm or his cottage. A difference of opinion over a bed of turnips or a rabbit or “any other kind of bird” is argued one side and then the other by the lawyers, and many people are questioned to ascertain who is wrong and who is right. But at the date when the first Beresford arrived at Waterford from over the channel, his majesty the king decided the ownership of the territory in Ireland according to his whims. A frown could cost a man a farm and a smile could win him one. But life has not been all sunshine and taffy for the Beresfords. They have had their troubles like the rest of us.

The city grew up around that monastery and was first composed of students who lived in huts and cabins of their own construction while they carried on their studies. Then business men and farmers began to come in and Cork became a place of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the Danish sea-rovers who, after plundering it again and again, took a fancy to the place and settled down here themselves. St. Fin-Barre was buried in his own church and his dust was afterward taken out of the tomb and enshrined in a silver reliquary which was carried away by one of the O’Briens when he drove the McCarthys, who happened to be a power in 1089, out of his stronghold and looted the place.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909).",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43948,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe

The name signifies “a rough glen,” and that describes it exactly—a deep cleft in the mountains, a gash which some irresistible glacier made ages ago in the rugged rocks, about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, which terminates upon an exquisite little sheet of water, a branch of the Bay of Bantry, on the far southwestern coast of Ireland. The glen is filled with wonderful trees and wonderful flowers, which seem to bloom perennially. The surrounding mountains are of the wildest description, being naked moorlands covered with heather and gorse and huge gray bowlders and peaks which project into the air. Among them, it is said, there are no less than 365 little lakes, that number having suggested to the pious peasants, who attribute everything to apostolic interposition, that some holy saint prayed effectually for a separate one to supply water for each day of the year. The rocks reach far away to the westward and down into the cold blue of an uneasy ocean, which beats impetuously upon the outer walls, but the water is seldom disturbed by more than a ripple within the bay.

The walls and the Gothic windows, the tower and several other distinctive features are well preserved, and the ivy drapery makes it an exquisite picture. The abbey stands within the park of two hundred and ninety acres that surrounds Muckross House and is the property of Lord Ardilaun, who has many beautiful places in different parts of Ireland, and cannot possibly enjoy them all; but none is so beautiful as Muckross House. He purchased the property of the Herbert family who inherited it from Florence MacCarthy More, who, in 1750 married Agnes, daughter of Edward Herbert of this county, and they had one son who was the last MacCarthy More in the direct line, and that famous family became extinct, for he died without issue in 1770, and the estate passed into the possession of his mother’s family, being the nearest relatives. The Honorable Arthur Herbert died in 1866, and a beautiful Celtic cross has been erected to his memory upon the highest hill in the neighborhood, overlooking the park that he prized so highly, and where he enjoyed so much pleasure. His widow and daughters lived there for thirty years until they expired, when the place was offered at auction and Lord Ardilaun bid it in for £63,000 for the estate, and paid £10,000 more for furniture, pictures, live stock, and other property, making it cost him altogether about £73,000. And now he offers it for sale—the whole thing, a house of thirty-two rooms, a park of two hundred and ninety acres, the ruins of Muckross Abbey, and history and legends galore—for £75,000. And perhaps he would take less from the proper person. In 1907 a syndicate was organized to purchase the place and turn it into a Monte Carlo. They proposed to make the handsome old mansion a gambling-house and erect a large hotel with all possible allurements near by; but when Lord Ardilaun learned of the scheme, he instructed his solicitors to insert in the deed a clause stipulating that it should be used for residential purposes only, and that made it worthless to the syndicate. So Muckross Abbey and its beautiful surroundings are still in the market.

The abbey dates back to the dawn of Christianity in Ireland, and its site was originally occupied in the fourth or fifth century by a monastery founded by St. Finian of Innisfallen and his monks. The present building, however, was erected by Donald MacCarthy More, Prince of Desmond, in 1330, and was finished by his son in 1340 for the Franciscan friars, who occupied it as a monastery and as a college. There was some kind of an institution on the same site between the monastery of St. Finian and the present one, for an ancient manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, gives an account of its destruction by fire in the eleventh century. The founder, Donald MacCarthy More, built the beautiful chapel as a burial place for himself and his posterity. It is also the burial place of the O’Donaghues of the Glens, and in the very center of the choir is a large square tomb in which was deposited the body of “The Great O’Donaghue,” the chieftain of the lakes, of whom Mr. Maurice R. Moriarity, the custodian, gives many interesting legends in his history of the ruins.

The O’Donaghues were connected by marriage with the MacCarthys, kings of Munster, and had their headquarters at Blarney Castle, near Cork. Twelve generations, so far as the inscriptions can be deciphered, of that proud family are lying there, and more than twenty generations of O’Donaghues. The last MacCarthy buried here was Florence, husband of Agnes Herbert, who lived in Muckross House until his death in 1770. The last O’Donaghue buried here was Donal, a direct descendant of The O’Donaghue of the Glens, who was a member of parliament and died in 1889. His son Jeffrey, “The O’Donaghue,” as the head of the family is always called, is a barrister living in Dublin, a gentleman of high reputation and much influence, although he has lost almost everything but his proud name and a lineage that is interwoven with the history of Ireland since human actions were recorded.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909).",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43954,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe
"Adare, Limerick","Adare, Limerick",52.5636,-8.7926,William Eleroy Curtis,1908,"Upon our way back to Limerick we stopped at Adare, which is considered the model village and belongs to the Earl of Dunraven, who has the enviable reputation of being one of the best landlords in Ireland. The village of Adare has about six hundred people living in model cottages, which he and his father built for them, with vegetable and flower gardens and everything that an Irish peasant could ask for, including both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. The former was once “The White Abbey,” founded by the Augustinians in 1230 and restored by the Earl of Dunraven in 1811 with great care. A portion of the monastery has been rebuilt for a national school and given to the Roman Catholics. The neighboring Franciscan Abbey, founded in 1315, was restored for use as the Protestant church in 1807. The Earl of Dunraven who lived in those days built a family mausoleum in connection with it, and turned the refectory of the monks into a schoolhouse for Protestant children. Although the earls of Dunraven have been members of the Church of Ireland, they have been generous and frequent benefactors of the Roman Catholic church, and there seem to have been successive generations of wise, thoughtful, and considerate men in that family.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909).",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43955,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe
"Galway, Galway","Galway, Galway",53.2707,-9.0568,William Eleroy Curtis,1908,"Galway is a foreign-looking little town, unlike any other we saw in Ireland, and much of the architecture is Dutch and Spanish, departing from the plain, ugly brick front without cornice or eaves which is so common elsewhere. The streets are irregular and run all sorts of ways; some very narrow and some very wide, and they vary in width at different places, with occasionally an odd-shaped space at the intersection. Everything looks old and shabby and out of repair. It is queer as well as significant to see buildings half in ruins in the principal streets and others with the glass broken out of the windows. There are some smart-looking shops, however, and neatly kept residences, but they are not frequent. Nor is the town well kept. The Common Council evidently lacks a sense of the æsthetic, because the streets are dirty, the park is scraggly, and the grass and trees are very much neglected. It is altogether the untidiest public park I saw in Ireland. Many of the people we met on the principal streets, particularly the women, are repulsive in their rags and dirty faces and unkempt hair and bare feet. We saw a few barefooted women in Tipperary and Limerick, but in Galway none of the working women wears shoes, although the men seem to be well shod. The women cover their heads with thick shawls that are often greasy and torn, and their faces show evidences of sorrow and privation, and perhaps other causes have left a mark.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909).",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43956,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe

The coast line is cut by deep jags and precipitous cliffs, like the fiords, and the mountains have the same stern and stony appearance, and the peat bogs that lie between them are similar to those in the Scandinavian countries, although the climate is much milder here. The fuchsia plant is commonly used for hedges, which all summer long is loaded with blossoms of purple and red. I had never seen a fuchsia hedge until I came to Ireland. The first was at Glengariff, on the southern coast, but since then we have found them everywhere along the Atlantic shore, in the western counties, hundreds of miles of them, inclosing pastures, meadows, and gardens and growing with wonderful luxuriance.","William Eleroy Curtis, One Irish Summer (New York: The University Press, Cambridge, 1909).",https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43957,Ireland,Western Europe; British Isles,Europe

Along the River side in the plaine standeth another street called Tizatlan, because there is much Lime and Chalke. In this street dwelled Xicotencatl, Captaine Generall of the whole Common-wealth.

The Town though it be not in the generall very rich, yet there are some Indian Merchants who trade about the country and especially to Suchutepeques where is the chief store of Cacao, and thereby some of this Towne of Sacapula, have inriched themselves; the rest of the people trade in pots and pans, which they make of an earth there fit for that purpose. But the principall Merchandize of this place is salt, which they gather in the morning from the ground that lyeth neere the River.

This Town is called Xocotenango, of a fruit named Xocotte, which is most plentifull there, and all about the Country; it is fresh and cooling, of a yellow colour when ripe, and of two sorts, some sweet, and others sowre, of the stones whereof the Indians make a fire; they lie so thick in the way, dropping from the trees for want of gathering and spending them all, that the Spaniards have begun to practise the buying of Hogs on purpose to let them runne about that high way, finding that they fat as speedily and as well with those plummes, as our Hogs doe in England with Akorns. All this way are also many faire gardens, which supply the Markets of Guatemala with herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers all the yeer. There are further in this Rode three water mills for the corn of the City, whereof the chief and the richest belongs to the Dominican Fryers of Guatemala, who keep there a Fryer constantly with three or foure Blackmores to doe and oversee the worke; What will not those Fryers doe to satisfie their covetous mindes?

Though the mountaines on each side doe strongly environ it, and especially on the East-side seem to hang over it, yet none of them are hinderers to Travellers, who over them have opened waies easie for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts.

West-ward to the South-sea the way lieth open through the valley and a champaigne Countrey. But South or South-East, the entrance is over high and steepy hils, which is the common Rode from Comayagua, Nicaragua, and the Golfo dulce or sweet Gulfe, where the ships come yeerly and unlade all the Commodities which are brought from Spaine for Guatemala. This also is the way followed by them who take a journey meer East-ward from this City. But the chiefest mountaines, which straighten in this City and valley are two, called Vulcanes, the one being a Vulcan of water, and the other a Vulcan or mountain of fire, termed so by the Spaniards, though very improperly a Vulcan may be said to containe water, it taking its name from the heathenish God Vulcan, whose profession and imployment chiefly was in fire. These two famous mountaines stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the valley; that of water hanging on the South-side almost perpendicularly over the City, the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old City. That of water is higher then the other, and yeelds a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the yeer green, and full of Indian Milpa's, which are plantations of Indian wheat; and in the small and petty Townes which lie some halfe way up it, some at the foot of it, there are Roses, Lillies, and other flowers all the yeer long in the gardens, besides Plantins, Apricockes, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits.

They have a short stumpy tail, which is kept in a perpetual jerk when they are excited. They select for their city a  level sandy plain, where they can easily dig their burrows. Their towns often rival in population the largest cities in Europe. There is frequently considerable regularity in ther  streets. Their houses consist of little mounds, often two or three feet high, with a hole in the center, two or three feet deep vertically. Then extending to their apartments. As soon as they see such a monster as man, each one scampers off to his own house, and squats down in his hole, peeping out and barking  lustily at the intruder, till he approaches too close, when they suddenly turn a sumer sault in to their burrows. If you are still, in a short time, they will look out again to reconnoiter.

The name it bears, and which has been given to it by modern travellers, has no connexion with its origin. Indeed, if we may credit Greek inscription, this monument is no older than the time of Dioclesian. It has a slight inclination to the South. The capital and base have never been finished. I did not measure its height; but it is loftier by two-thirds than the palm-trees around it. Cleopatra's Needles, of which one (as I before re- marked) has fallen, are obelisks of red granite, having three columns of hieroglyphics on each side. [...] The antique thimbles, which served for the base of these obelisks, still re- main; they rest on socles of three steps, are of Greco- Romanic construction, and confirm the architectural date of the received tradition, which affirms that their second erection occurred about forty years before CHRIST.","Dumas, Alexander.

Road from Alexandria to Damanhour,Road from Alexandria to Damanhour,31.113963,30.191544,Alexander Dumas,1830,"The road from Alexandria to Damanhour is remarkable for nothing but its sterility. We waded through a sea of sand, in which our attendants and asses sank knee-deep. Occasionally we were blind- ed by gusts of hot wind mixed with dust; and we knew, from the momentary oppression at our lungs, as it passed, that we were encountering the burning breath of the Desert. Here and there, on either hand, were circular villages, built on the rising ground, which, during the overflow of the Nile, be- come islands. The houses are of a conical form, built of brick and earth, and pierced with small, square holes, designed to admit just as much light as is strictly necessary, with just as little heat as possible. At intervals, too, we passed several isolated tombs of hermits and dervises, each shaded by a palm tree; that consecrated friend of the sepulchre, around the tops of which clouds of shrieking hawks flew at our approach.","Dumas, Alexander.

Road from Damanhour to Rosetta,Road from Damanhour to Rosetta,31.088309,30.475414,Alexander Dumas,1830,"... at five hundred paces distance from Damanhour, were in the midst of the Desert, - so closely do the extremes of civilization and desolation approximate in this eastern world.
We trudged along for several hours through the sand ; and then, ascending a hill, we unexpectedly saw from its summit the Nile !
Delightful landscapes now succeeded arid plains. In place of a palm-tree here and there lost in the burning horizon, we found forests of fruit-trees and fields of maize. Egypt is a valley, with a river in its centre and an immense garden on each side, shut in by the Desert. Birds of ruby and emerald, of brilliant song and plumage, unknown to us, fill the groves of mimosa and lilachs. Large droves of sheep and buffalo, led by lean, naked herdsmen, followed the course of the Nile which we were ascending. And, finally, by way of climax, two enormous wolves, attracted no doubt by the scent of the cattle, emerged from a wood fifty yards in front, and came to a halt as if to arrest our progress : our guides, however, succeeded in beating them off with stones. Night descended rapidly, and our way, intersected by ditches necessary to the irrigation of the country, became more and more toilsome. In many places our asses sunk to their knees in the swamps, and we were obliged to dismount; and occasionally we ford- ed actual torrents, wading to our armpits : this sort of bath, though much cooler, was also much less agreeable than that of Alexandria. At length the moon arose in full brilliancy, illumined our path, and gave a new character to this strange landscape. Despite our embarrassments, we could not be insensible to its beauties. On the summit of the hills which divide the valley from the Desert, the palm-trees gracefully waved their branches against the sky. Mosques were visible in every direction, their bases laved by the Nile, their walls surrounded by the shade and verdure of the sycamore. But we were constantly interrupted in our ecstacy, by a bog or a ditch ; so that, by the time Rosetta was in sight, we were drenched altogether, and our shoes, like Panurge's, took in water from our shirt-collars.","Dumas, Alexander.

The Nile, which here forms a commodious port, flows also through large and beautiful rice-fields; and the delicate green of that plant contrasts finely with the sombre masses of dark sycamores and towering palms.","Dumas, Alexander.

This oriental edifice stands in the midst of a charming landscape, and reaches far into the river, leaving a narrow pas- sage between its base and the opposite shore. A dome in the form of a heart reversed, surmounted by a crescent, crowns its white and festooned walls : from one of the angles, a madeneh of rare elegance elevates its galleries, while the opposite side seems to uphold an enormous mass of sand, resting like a hill on the declivity of the mountain. Tall palm- trees, also, shoot up their single stems through the thick and sombre foliage of the sycamores, crowning them as with an aigrette. The true believers say that the holy dervise, Abou-Mandour, sustains on his shoulders the mountains of sand which seem ready to swallow up the mosque, and choke the current of the Nile.","Dumas, Alexander.

We were unable to turn away from the gigantic monuments to which belonged so grand a record of antiquity, and so glorious a memento of modern days. There, too, was the battle-field of the modern Cambyses, where we, like Herodotus viewing the corses of the Persians and Egyptians, might have discovered the bones of our fathers. As the sun descended, his beams climbed the sides of the Pyramids, leaving their base in shade ; soon the summit alone sparkled, like a reddened point, and then a single ray, like a dis- tant beacon-light, seemed to float on the sharpened extremity. This soon detached itself and ascended towards the sky, as if to light up the stars, which, a moment after, began to twinkle in the firmament.","Dumas, Alexander.

At the foot of the Lybian range we began to perceive, through the sandy va- pours that darkened the air, the towers and domes of mosques surmounted with their crescents of bronze. By degrees this curtain, driven by the northern wind which wafted us along, was uplifted from Cairo, and we discovered the jagged outline of the tops of the buildings, their foundations being yet hidden by the swollen banks of the river.","Dumas, Alexander.

The lines traced on it indicate the years when the overflow of the water, reaching an unusual elevation, causes seasons of remarkable fertility. Here, every year, the sheiks of the mosques declare the height of the inundation, and apportion the measure of rejoicing which the people may indulge in ; or, with the resignation of Mussulmans, announce sterility and the fasting and famine to which the insufficient rising of the river condemns them. On our right stood the Pyramids of Gizeh, visible from the base to the summit; and there, too, was the hill formed by the Great Sphinx, which has guarded them for three thousand years, turning its granite face, mutilated by the soldiers of Cambyses, towards the tomb of the Pharaohs.

Isle of San Simon y Judas,Tauere,-17.37747,-141.50552,Raimundo Bonacorsi,1772,"We had been seeing some sea-fowl as we went along ever since we started, and these became more numerous and diverse in kind the farther we ran down our longitude; so that we observed the greatest care in our navigation by day, and especially by night.
 
  But all our watchfulness did not Isle of prevent us from discovering, at daybreak on the 28th of October, and already astern of us, a very flat palm-covered islet, which we must perforce have passed very close to in the course of the night. We made every endeavour to come up with it, but did not succeed until the third day ; when, having seen it to be inhabited, because of some big smokes they made, we got the boat into the water and she went away to reconnoitre the island with Lieut. Don Thomas Gayangos (and thenceforward every time the boat made a trip we went in her by turns) and her crew with their arms and other usual precautions. They examined the greater part of it, but found no spot where they could land, as the island is fringed all round with a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, making it impossible to get close in without involving great risk to the boat and crew. [...] 
 From 26 to 20 Indians followed along the beach abreast of our boat, as well as on the reef and even in the water : it was observed that they were all pretty brown in colour, and there were two or three among them of more than ordinary stature. All were naked except for a whitey-grey breech-clout with which they had their parts covered.
 
  Their hair was bristly and cut short at the neck, and in their hands they carried a long white club with a knob at one end; while, besides this long one, some of them held in the other hand another shorter one, about a vara in length, of some dark coloured or black wood. They set up a great yelling and made various signs by which we under- stood quite well that they meant defiance, and that they had no fear (though we could not be sure of this). They had neither women nor old men among them.
 
  The entire island consists of a strip of low-lying land surrounding a lagoon within it which covers more surface than the whole of the land does; and on this we sawtwo canoes, one of them with two Indians and the other with six. The land is clothed all over with greenery, mostly scrub, and in parts there are some trees with medium-sized trunks and spreading branches. Coco-nut palms are the most numerous, and one may suppose that they get their breech-clouts from these, as well as the chief part of their sustenance; supplemented only by fish, of which there should be good store in the lagoon. The land is so low and flat that, when a short distance off, only the palms are to be seen, and these look as if growing out of the sea. By their antics, yells, and wonderment, one may believe that they have never seen any ship before.
 
  No harbour was made out at any part of the island. It is situated, according to our observations and reckoning, in lat. 17° 20' S. and long. 240° 28' from the meridian of Tenerife! Our compass showed 8° 21' of Variation N.Ely.
 
  It extends approximately three miles N. and S. and four E. and W.: in circumference ten miles. It is 1145 leagues distant from the Port of El Callao. The name of San Simón y Judas was given to it. Its examination being completed and a plan drawn of it as well as could be done from bearings, we delayed no longer, since this was not the island contemplated in our commission; and we pursued our course with the wind aft, moderate, from the E. and E.S.E.","Bonacorsi, Raimundo. “Voyage to the Island of Otayty Performed by Don Domingo Bonechea, Capital in the Royal Nacy, Commanding the Frigate of War Named La Aguila by Order of the Most Excellent the Lord Viceroy of Peru Don Manuel De Amat: 26th September 1772.” In The Quest and Occupation of Tahiti by Emissaries of Spain During the Years 1772-1776: Told in Despatches and Other Contemporary Documents, edited and translated by Bolton Glanvill Corney, 29-.

Isle of San Quintin,Haraiki,-17.44823,-143.46757,Raimundo Bonacorsi,1772,"On the morning of the 31st of the same month of October we dis covered another island, which, from a distance, appeared like only a palm clump of the same kind as the former one ; and, as the wind was fresh and fair, it gave us an opportunity of coasting almost all round it in the Frigate, under short canvas and at a very little distance off, to reconnoitre for an anchorage while taking bearings as its extremities and outline came into view. It is low-lying land like the other ; and covered all over with brushwood, small trees and palms. It has a large lagoon within, occupying its centre, oval in outline like its circumference: we saw a canoe upon it towards the N.W. side.
 
 The natives made big smokes, and about 12 or 14 Indians were seen, apparently of the same type as those of the other isle of San Simón, with their long pikes in their hands, breech-clouts, and one amongst them who looked like a woman leading a small child by the hand. They made signs to us as if desirous that we should land, which we did not attempt to do, because it was clearly impossible, owing to the beach being everywhere beset with reefs and rocks on which there was a heavy breaking sea, and over which the water enters and leaves the lagoon-from which I conclude there is no channel into it. There are but few inhabitants in all the island. Those we saw appeared to be peaceably disposed, for of the small number who followed along the beach after the Frigate all were not armed with spears or long pikes; and their having women and children with them, and making signs for us to go in to where they were, makes one think this.

Island of Todos Santos,Anaa,-17.41018,-145.49319,Raimundo Bonacorsi,1772,"In the forenoon of the 9th of October we discovered another island of the same kind as the others, though larger.
We came near to it later and the boat went away to examine the E. and E.N.E. part of it, but found no place where a landing was practicable. She stayed but a few hours, however, as she was recalled from on board to bear a hand in towing the Frigate round the S.E. point of a bight in which she had got embayed very close in to the shore, through the wind having died down almost to a calm. We succeeded in working her clear of the land and the boat afterwards went in again to coast along and explore the S. and S.W. sides as far as to the N.W., taking soundings and noting down its points, bays, and lagoons, while we followed her at a moderate distance, N.W. But she neither found any appearance of bottom nor any place where the Frigate might let go an anchor : nor were they able to approach the beach anywhere without boat and crew becoming exposed to great risk (which our business did not warrant). Seeing then that the shore line from the N.W. round towards the N. was even more exposed and that the surf was breaking much more heavily along it, and that it was moreover begirt with reefs without a span's length of sandy beach anywhere', the boat was signalled to come away. 
Some 20 Indians of all ages and sexes were counted on the beach in the forenoon, whose build, clothing and weapons were the same as those of the other islands : there are some pretty blonde in hue, others of a tawny colour with frizzly hair, and others again with purely Indian features and the hair lank. The women were draped from the waist to their knees with the same material as the men's breech-clouts; and figured with blue on the shoulders, the entire buttocks, trunk, arms, and legs, in various patterns and stripes. In the afternoon also a great many collected when the boat approached, and as fast as she drew ahead some of them dropped behind, while fresh ones came out from their villages to replace them. Two of them were wearing strings of shells round their necks, and a woman was seen fishing in the lagoon with her net. 
This island is larger than the others, but it, too, consists of very low-lying land surrounded by a reef which makes the islets that shut in the lagoon on its western side communicate with each other. These islets are also in- habited, and the whole island appears to teem with people, of whom the greater number are on the E. side. The soil is very fertile, for it is all covered with greenery and full of trees, especially coco-nut palms. Their dwellings are huts thatched with palm leaves, dotted about amidst the groves of palms. No doubt, by the signs they made, they are peaceably disposed ; although these too were almost all armed with very long spears or pikes, without knobs but having very sharp points"". 
This island is situated in lat. 17° 55' S. and long. 236° 55'. Our compass showed 8° 15' of variation Nly. It extends twenty miles S.E. and N.W., and nine S.W. and N.E. Its circumference may be forty-nine miles; and it bears E. and W. 17° 30' Southerly with that of San Quintín, distant 32 leagues, and from El Callao 1214. It was allotted the name of Todos Santos'.","Bonacorsi, Raimundo. “Voyage to the Island of Otayty Performed by Don Domingo Bonechea, Capital in the Royal Nacy, Commanding the Frigate of War Named La Aguila by Order of the Most Excellent the Lord Viceroy of Peru Don Manuel De Amat: 26th September 1772.” In The Quest and Occupation of Tahiti by Emissaries of Spain During the Years 1772-1776: Told in Despatches and Other Contemporary Documents, edited and translated by Bolton Glanvill Corney, 29-.

Peak of San Cristóbal,Meheti'a,-17.8775,-148.06691,Raimundo Bonacorsi,1772,"In fact on the morning of the 16th of November at ten o'clock we sighted high land in the W.S.W. and made every endeavour to get near to it while daylight lasted.
 
 Seeing, as we approached, that it was no more than a high peak, the Comandante decided to reconnoitre it that same afternoon; and, being a moderate distance off by four o'clock, the boat went away to examine it, with the same precautions as usual (notwithstanding it was thought to be uninhabited).
 
  While the boat was still a good way off we saw number of people on the N.E. side clothed in white, and two canoes with two nude Indians in each. One of these came towards us and presently.. ... to suit her. She arrived in fact at a quarter after five, with her two Indians, who brought coco-nuts, which they at once handed up (the side) and gave in exchange for some trifle.
 
  What they asked for was in their language Curi, which we afterwards understood to be their name for nails or any other bits of iron? They would not come on board, nor accept anything after they had got through all their stock of coco-nuts for barter, in spite of our pressing invitations and coaxing; and as it was now late they took themselves off, making signs to us that they would return at sunrise.
 
  The two Indians, though somewhat timorous, nevertheless showed themselves very affable, vivacious and intelligent.
 
  In appearance they are well favoured, of good stature, fairly light in hue, being merely browned by the sun, and some- what tawny about their features and hair, which is crinkly and sticks up in an even mass all over. They had only breech-clouts on, the buttocks and hands being figured with a pigment between lead-colour and blue; and they were without weapons ofThe boat went on with her exploration round the island, and brought up with the grapnel at a spot on the W. side, between two rocks, where some of our people landed; but the warp having parted, and it being already late, they withdrew.
 
  In the early morning as many as eight canoes with two or three Indians in each having managed to get quite close to the ship by daybreak, all bent on the same traffic as the previous afternoon's, many of them ventured on board, clambering up the side with great agility; and seeming very happy, taking notice of everything, but not showing much wonder.
 
 At half-past eight our boat returned to the shore (and with her all the canoes) for the purpose of taking soundings and ascertaining whether it might be possible to anchor with the Frigate, both for our better satisfaction and to fill some water. One party of our men landed by means of the Indians' canoes at the same spot where they had done so the afternoon before, while the other party proceeded all round the island in the boat, taking soundings, and sketching a plan of it as they went. They found, however, no anchorage, whether for the Frigate or for the boat; nor, again, any place adapted for easily watering ship.
 
  But they saw some twenty Indians or so of all ages and sexes, who comprised apparently all that were in the island.
 
  Accompanied and guided by a large number of these our men struck inland for something like a mile along a beaten path, and beyond that they had to clamber up by holding on to the roots of trees that stuck out from rifts in the rocks. They saw two clusters of huts, one of five and the other of seven huts, constructed of palm leaves, the poles of which they are framed being very neatly fitted together. Their greatest height is 3.5 varas, length from 8 to 10, and width 4.5 to 5.5: they are closed in only overhead. We found the jawbone of a corpse hanging up in one hut. Their furniture and chattels consist of little baskets and mats made of palm leaves and rushes; and in some cases a small wooden stool, very skilfully carved all out of one block and having its seat concave! In another there was a puppy of medium size, black and tan, with ears pointed and erect. In others they came across some pens containing pigs as large and as fat as those of Perú, and farther on a stone enclosure of 20 or 25 varas, decorated round about with posts carved as if with characters, which the Indians would not approach ; for, by the look of it, it is their burial place', which they hold in great respect.
 
  They keep their fire below ground”, covered over with black porous stones' which lie strewn about the entire path and a good part of the hill. The whole of this latter is verdant and pleasing to the view ; but on the S.E and S.W. sides the soil is very fertile, and there the natives have their plantations of yams, plantains, coco-nut palms and other trees, some of which bear a sort of pine-cone of which they merely chew the segments at their insertion“, and others a fruit of the size and shape of an ordinary chirimoya, which, when cooked, is somewhat insipid but not ill tasted"". There are three different kinds of plantains, one of which is noteworthy for its size, for each fruit is nearly three inches in diameter and a cuartas in length: they eat these roasted. They make a sort of mash of these fruits with which they keep themselves sleek and lusty.
 
  Biscuits and salt pork are the only eatables of ours that they care for. In addition to the breech-clout, the men have some ponchos of finely made matting, and the women certain white drapery that they get from the bark of a tree after much beating out and working up. They clothe themselves with these from the waist downwards, and many of them over the whole figure.
 
  The carpenter, also, went exploring ; but did not find anything particular in the way of timbers. They do all their wood-working with their stone hatchets and adzes, after the manner of our iron ones. They were shown howto plant and sow, and seeds of all the kinds we had on board were given to them.
 
 Neither minerals, nor aromatic plants, nor any spice tree, were observed. They have plenty of water of good quality ; but in a very inaccessible situation.
 
  Nor was any image of importance noticed amongst them, nor did it appear that they render worship or adoration either to any animate thing or imaginary being.
 
  As our people were coming away an old man presented a pig to the officer, without expecting anything in exchange ; and after bestowing ample rewards or gratuities on them, our men embarked, and with them three Indians all in very happy mood, while some canoes followed after the boat.
 
  On seeing that she was being hoisted in and that we were going farther away, and already leaving them astern, two of the Indians departed : and we were only able to retain one, who came along quite unconcernedly. We heard him, and others too, several times mention “OTAHEYTE,” the name of the island the Instructions directed us to investigate, at the same time pointing to the W.

 The name of Cerro de San Cristóbal was given to this island, and the Indians call it Omayto.","Bonacorsi, Raimundo. “Voyage to the Island of Otayty Performed by Don Domingo Bonechea, Capital in the Royal Nacy, Commanding the Frigate of War Named La Aguila by Order of the Most Excellent the Lord Viceroy of Peru Don Manuel De Amat: 26th September 1772.” In The Quest and Occupation of Tahiti by Emissaries of Spain During the Years 1772-1776: Told in Despatches and Other Contemporary Documents, edited and translated by Bolton Glanvill Corney, 29-.

Isla de Amat,Tahiti,-17.65091,-149.42604,Raimundo Bonacorsi,1772,"The name ISLA DE AMAT was given to this island.
It extends N.N.W. and S.S.E. nine leagues, W.N.W. and E.S.E. thirteen and a half leagues, circumference from forty to forty-five leagues; and lies sixteen leagues distant from the small island of San Cristobal, and 1274 from El Callao. 
In figure it is like two islands united by a tongue of land two leagues in width which forms two lovely bays on its N.E. and S.E.' sides respectively; and the whole is encircled by a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, some three to as much as six cables distant from the main shore. Within this the sea is absolutely smooth. 
There are only two short stretches off the N. and S. extremities [of the island] where there is no reef and the coast is exposed. For entering through the reef and reaching the land there are several breaks with channels of ample depth which expand inside into roadsteads or regular harbours as the plan shows; although it is to be noted that only the one where we lay at anchor in the Frigate (called after Santa Maria Magdalena) on the S.E. side, in the district of Sallalara’, is at present properly surveyed and has had any exact plan made of it. Time did not permit of so detailed an examination of the others; and one ought to be very careful in entering or leaving by them all, their mouths being skirted by low reefs which are not noticed save at very short range, besides which the wind is apt to die away in the entrance, and in such case any vessel may become endangered by the tides and currents. For these reasons it is necessary to try to pass in with a good steady breeze, in the morning and on the flood tide, for the ebb is much stronger and lasts (at any rate at the surface) a longer time. In the harbour of Santa Maria Magdalena during the full and change [of the moon] high water occurs at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the rise is only from one to one and a half fathoms.
There are rocky patches dotted about over the bottom, too, which cause much injury to one's cables. 
Most of the country-side is mountainous and rugged, and only on the N.W. and S.W. sides are there any level tracts and gently sloping valleys, besides the strip of land formed by the large bays on its N.E. and S.W. Never- theless it consists of black soil throughout, very fertile and well wooded,-strewn, indeed, with some loose stones, but covered everywhere with wild herbage, trees of various kinds and sizes, brushwood and thorns, which form, in places, dense and impenetrable thickets. Water is very plentiful, for permanent streams pour down most of the ravines and unite at the skirts of the hills to form middling- sized brooks and rivers. Most of the cultivation is to be found in the valleys and flats which extend from the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach, for it is here only that the natives reside ; and, in places, these are only two or three cables or even less, in width. Only the district of Payala is fairly broad. Palms with many coco-nuts are in the greatest abundance, for the entire island is fringed with these trees which, from a little distance off, afford a most beautiful prospect. There are five kinds of plantains: two of them especially noteworthy, the one for its size, and the other for its fine flavour; the latter being something like those they call “de la tierra"" at Lima. They have plenty of yams, of which they plant quantities, and these serve them, together with the other fruits I have mentioned in the description of Mount San Cristobal, for preparing certain puddings and mashes that they partially bake, and after- wards eat cold: and which are very nourishing for them. 
There are also other fruits that they do not cultivate, some having the taste of a chestnut, others of a walnut, others of an apple; but they are not like those of Europe as to their form, nor as to the trees (they grow on), and are generally all of the poorest flavour to our palates. The few red sweet potatoes they also possess are exceedingly well-tasted. There is a root resembling ginger, and there are some white flowers like daisies, with a very nice scent: others in the likeness of poppies, which are also very pretty to look at, but the rest are commonplace”. 
Those who fare best are the Caciques and headmen, for they possess pigs of fair size, and also fowls; because (although we saw none) those who went round the island in the launch heard hens and cocks crow on two mornings, and they (the Chiefs] told us so too. Thus it is that the arii or Caciques are all stout, some of them to ungainliness, so that they have two Indians constantly kneading their legs and even then are scarcely able to stand upright.
The common people frequently suffer a dearth of food, and most of them support themselves on cockles, and some fish which they eat raw. The good and finer fish, of which there is great plenty in the sea, are (reserved) for the arii and principal persons. The men eat apart from the women, and they tuck such quantities into their mouths that they can scarcely chew: so that these all become regular little baker's ovens. 
There are dogs of several breeds: some quite small, and others very large and hairy. Mice in plenty and very tame. Of special birds only blue parroquets with red bill and feet; but there are parrots, wood-pigeons and many other common birds. In the space of two leagues for which [our people) were able to penetrate into the interior in the neighbourhood of the harbour, though they did so with much labour on account of the rugged nature of the hillsides and denseness of the forest, a few good timbers were noted; some like a kind of lignum vitae, others resembling the yellow guaiacum, others seemingly adapted for yards and topmasts, others for knees and various requirements in shipbuilding, and yet others apparently serviceable, but of which no proper opinion could be formed because we were unacquainted with their lasting qualities and grain.

Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"Buenos Aires is now undoubtedly the capital of South America by right of its position , its wealth, its population and its magnificence. The fault of it is that it is too large. Nearly one-fifth of the population of Argentina is to be found condensed in Buenos Aires, and much of it is urgently wanted elsewhere. It has survived all the vicissitudes of early colonization, and lived to complete in another half its destiny as the most magnificent and ""up to date"" of all the cities of South America. It is not a new growth, an upstart, liek many of the mushroom cities of North America. It possesses a history and the respectability which belongs of right to a town owning stirring traditions lasting through centuries. As a town, it belongs to a fine old worl aristocracy, and the same air which pervades Rio de Janeiro is perceptible in Buenos Aires, undestroyed, uncontaminated even, by the busy chaos of telephone wires, electric tram constructions, and other accessories of modern civilization which enclose it as an iron network.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America

Since the dignified old Emperor Pedro stepped down from his throne to make way for the republic, Brazil has retrograded step by step. This is frankly admitted by Brazilians themselves, although they would not have the Empire back with magmficent possessions of as vet undeveloped natural resources, and a rich heritage of splendid possibilities, the material prosperity, the credit, and the respectability of Brazil has rather diminished than increased. Some of these national assests departed with the Empire, and Rio de Janeiro bears witness to a general downward tendency.

Fashionable Buenos Aires, at the fashionable hour, circulates chiefly about the Florida, or drifts slowly to the north-west in the direction of the Palermo. It is here that one meets all the most effective dandies and the best-dressed women of the town, and the beauty of the gardens whitch stretch away on either side of the road, the attractions of the racecourse, and of certain sporting accessories, are quite sufficient to justify the popularity of this society migration. Added to other advantages the lighting arrangements by electricity are perfect.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America

Italians are a great force in Buenos Aires. Out of teh 800,000 inhabitants of the city some 300,000 are Italian. But it is very difficult to determine the proportion between the floating foreign population and the permanent colonists.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America

The difficulty of access is often quoted as a guarantee for the security of the town in case of war. It would be impossible to bombard Buenos Aires from any point attainable by ships of sufficient capacity to effect a bombardment. But military safety hardly compensates for commercial inconvenience. [...] The approach to Buenos Aires from the sea after leaving the coast port of Monte Video is up the broad estuary of the La Plata-- an estuary so broad that land cannot be distinguished on the horizon of its wide red shimmering surface. But in all this width it is difficult to find a channel for oceangoing streamers drawing 25 feet.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America

Ten million sterling are said to have been spent over La Plata without touching the port. But it has no trade or industry of its own. No busy traffic fills its wide, grass grown, deserted streets. There would be no inhabitants but for Buenos Aires.

Delta between Las Palmas and the Parana River,"Lujan River, Buenos Aires",-34.34202,-58.59132,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"Into the Tigre there flows a broad, flat stream called Las Palmas (or Lujan) which runs more or less parallel to the Parana, leaving a wide space of rich delta between them, intersected by a network or innumerable minor channels and waterways. Here on a Sunday morning a great part of Buenos Aires society loses itself. There are yacht clubs and rowing clubs, and every species of waterside amusement at the end of the 21 mile run by rail from the city, and there is enough space in the woods and gardens of the delta to absorb the whole pleasure-loving population of the city. Within memory of living people this delta was covered by forest and undergrowth thick enough to contain the lairs of the spotted jaguar of South America, which has left its name to the river but is no more to be found in its neighborhood. This is the fruit-growing suburb of the town. Miles upon miles of peach trees, mixed with figs and other fruit, extend in lines along the banks of the streams and canals, well-tended and cared for, and teh amount of fruit that is thrown upon the market from the delta country must be often in excess of the demand, even in this fruit-eating centre. The surface of the river is occasionally covered with the floating debris of the market gardens. A curious population has sprung up in the delta, which, I am told, is an admixture of Basque, Spaniard, and Italian, speaking Spanish and living an easy, indolent life in a sort of Eden which requires but little delving. They are a cheery, good-looking people, bright, intelligent, and contented, taking no great interest in politics, and indifferent to the revolutionary agitaions which occasionally rage around them. The richness of the delta alluvium extends to the districts which border it. It is on Las Palmas that the most productive grazing land in Buenos Aires providence is to be found. It is here that it is possible to put sixty sheep to an acre of grass (one hardly likes to write it down!), and these sixty sheep will live on that same acre all the year round. Cattle raising and agriculture are the backbones of the Argentine industry; the future of the country mostly depends on them.

At any rate I observed that the women love to place themselves in artistic rows (there is, by the way, one gallery reserved for women only), and admit of no ugly black and white blotches of male attire to interfere with the harmony of their perfect colour arrangements. It almost appears as if each individual unit dressed with a view to the effect of the whole company. And the total effect is brilliant, harmonious, and infinitely delicate and pleasing in colour expression. The opera itself is excellent ; no expense is spared by a music-loving people to obtain the best artists in the world. But that is a detail. No one goes to the Buenos Aires opera merely to listen to the music.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
"Iguazu Falls, Misiones Territory","Iguazu Falls, Misiones Province",-25.69086,-54.44081,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"It is in this territory that the Iguazu river joins the Parana on its left bank. Twenty kilometres (about 12 1/2 miles) from the junction are the famous falls of Iguazu, which may well be called phenomenal not only for the great beauty of their surroundings, but for their magnitude. More than a mile in width, and with a fall of over 200 feet, the whole volume of the river thunders down in a double cascade, sending up thick clouds of spray amidst the dense vegetation of a sub-tropical forest. The attraction of such scenery will tend rapidly to the development of the Misiones territory. Already the great landscape gardener of Buenos Aires, M. Thays, has taken the approaches to the falls in hand. A road of twelve or thirteen miles has been cut through the virgin forest, and every point of view which can give new interest to this magnificent spectacle will be made available. It will not be long before the great falls of South America will be as much of a world's show as those of the North.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
"Mendoza, Mendoza Province","Mendoza, Mendoza Province",-32.88945,-68.84583,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"[...] all the country wears the familiar aspect of artificial cultivation-- intersperse with willows, poplars, tamarisk, little water-channels, stony beds of dry nullahs waiting for the rains-- all under a dull yellow haze which tells of heat and dryness and veils the empty spaces in the landscape. Mendoza is not the Mendoza of Spanish foundation in 1561. That lasted 300 years, and was completely destroyed by earthquake in 1861. [...] The present Mendoza is new, and looks it. the streets appear unfinished and teh houses stand in irregular and uneven rows on either side of them. the long avenue of the central boulevard has none of the grace of mature age, and the by-ways are but incomplete and muddy tracks, leading ti unknown surroundings.

The ""Bodegas,"" or wine making establishments of Mendoza, are its most attractive feature. A short drive from the station took us to one or two of the principal bodegas, which appear to carry on a large and successful trade in the peculiar wine of the country. It is a rough produce, and it never travels far. [...] There was one feature in the vineyards, noticeable by reason of its peculiarity. In the centre of each large field, an instrument which looked like a huge funnel or blunderbuss, was set up endways with its wide mouth pointing to the sky. It was, indeed, a blunderbuss of a special pattern, adapted for firing blank charges at thunderclouds in order to avert the plague of hail. Hail works destruction in vineyards all the world over; but it appears to be only in Italy and at Mendoza that this system of precipitating rain (and thus forestalling hail) is adopted.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
"The hills outside Mendoza, Mendoza Province","Mendoza, Mendoza Province",-32.8633,-68.96366,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"The short halt at Mendoza was sufficient to introduce a new branch of teh military service to our attention-- a most important branch-- the mountain artilery. As the four batteries filed along teh boulevard under the chequered shadow of the trees they looked smart and servicable, well equipped, and well found both in men and mules. The men were distinctly above the average Argentine in physique, and some of teh mules were splendid animals. they form a new feature in the Argentine service, and it is certainly remarkable how soon both men and animals have been trained into all the outward appearance of smartness. [...] The uniform of light blue and white was perhaps a litte gay for artillery, but it was most effective for parade purposes. The batteries were brought into action just under the hills outside Mendoza. there was no hitch in the proceedings such as might have been expected with recruits so recently trained to the role of gunners, and the shooting appeared to be straight and effective. It would almost seem as if gunners, equally with cavalry, are ""born, not made,"" in Argentina.

Naturally one expected to hear from the military officials of Argentina some expression of dissapointment at the prospect of peace after such elaborate and expensive preporations for war had been completed ; and undoubtedly the disappointment existed, but it was unexpressed. There was throughout the service a spirit of self-contained reserve in speaking of the chances of war which impressed me greatly.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
"The Andes, Mendoza Province","The Andes, Mendoza Province",-32.68256,-69.3617,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"From Mendoza there starts a metre-gauge railway (the trans-Andine) up the barren valleys which lead to the Uspallata pass. Over the rising slopes which border the foothills, between stony unprofitable shelves of detritus and a scanty scrub of salt bush and acacia (growing scantier with the rise of the country), the rail runs easily. It might be a tract in the Baluch lowlands, or in the South African Karoo that we pass over-but for the frequent cactus. As we rise higher the hills grow to greatness, the landscape becomes variegated in colour, marbled on the hill-side with splashes of pink where the granite outcrop occurs, and powdery white about the lower slopes. But the prevailing tint is red. Bush there is little or none, but the feathery pampas grass fits itself into cracks and clefts, advertising its existence with waving plumes ; Farther up the line, where it twists in and out of frequent gullies, and breaks into ladder-rail to lift it over steeper grades, the walls of the valley approach each other. The river, smaller and swifter, and no longer meandering from side to side of the flat bottom of a slabsided canon, becomes white with the milky outflow of the glacier, and the stone-strewn sides of the slopes above it stand at steep angles. Now and then a perfect fan, smoothed and rounded, radiates out from a crack in the mountains, and down its steepest slope (just where the water-parting should be) is cut the water-course, defying all ordinary problems of gravitation and offering despair to the topographer. On the whole, I must confess to disappointment with my first view of the Andes. I did not expect Himalayan scenery, but I did expect something of the softer charm which radiates everlastingly from the pine-clad summits of the European Alps.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
"Puente del Inca, Mendoza Province","Puente del Inca, Mendoza Province",-32.8222,-69.92371,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"In March, 1902, the Argentine section of the trans-Andine line ended abruptly at Puente del Inca (the Inca's bridge), where a remarkable natural bridge spans the river, and which is necessarily (in this country) attributed to the Incas. [...] However, the bridge of Puente del Inca has nothing really to do with the Incas. It is a curious natural feature that few people take the trouble to go and see. There is a very fairly comfortable hotel here, but the place and the hotel have already be left behind by the railway, which now reaches to Las Cuevas, just under the smooth slopes which entail the final struggle to the windy summit of the pass. When we passed that way in 1902, a night at the hotel and a drive in the very early hours of the morning was a necessity of the situation. The early drive was cold, and the party packed into the wagonette (drawn by four mules abreast) was too cold to be interested in the surroundings. The sky was clear and the stars intensely brilliant . At Las Cuevas (the present terminus) a change of animals was necessary, and the rest of the drive was but a weary drag up a dusty series of zigzags to the summit, nearly 12,000 feet above sea level.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Argentina,Latin America,South America
Juncal,El Juncal,-32.86715,-70.14974,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"From the Chilean rail end (which is nowhere in particular) to Las Cuevas on the Argentine side of the pass is about nine hours' drive (say fifty miles) with Juncal as a midway halting-place. That drive to the roadside station of the narrow gaugue line was delightful: a broad, flat, white road, with easy grades; a gradual descent through flying clouds of dust to the sweet valley of the Aconcagua; a gentle change from the snow-patched crags of the summit and the stone-strewed slopes of the landslips below, to a tangle of wild green things admist which the tall fat spikes of a red-haired cactus stood up stiffly and strangely. It was all impressive, because it was so new, and so unlike anything that I had seen before. There was a certain familiarity about a rope bridge, across (or along) which an old woman was hauling herself slowly as she sat in the pendent wire loop. It was barbaric and hardly expected; and the galloping horses, driven in a circle over the wheat spread beneath them to be threshed, was another quaint glimpse of mediæval methods surviving in the modern world.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Chile,Latin America,South America

No boom such as led to the adornment and advancement of Buenos Aires has ever poured temporary wealth into the municipal treasury of Santiago, and there are many indications to the casual observer that in some particulars at least economy has been permitted to tread too closely on the skirts of sanitary prudence [...] But having mentioned that the sanitation of the city leaves much to be desired, and that the streets, and the roads into which the streets lengthen, are hardly up to date, there is much in Santiago which is very attractive, and a great deal that is impressive.

Puerto Montt,Puerto Montt,-41.46891,-72.94113,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"... without waiting for any general scheme for fresh conservancy, the introduction of the Oregon pine into Chilean forestry has already commenced. Plantations have been formed near Talcahuano. There is, nevertheless, quite a large variety of useful timber from the southern forest already in the wood market, and so much demand has already been made on the best and most useful classes of wood, that large areas near the coast (notably, near Puerto Montt) have been denuded of much magnificent timber without any attempt at replacing it by plantation, or hope of preserving it by any system of conservancy. It was a reckless disregard of all ordinary laws of forestry which permitted the destruction of teh splendid growth of the alerce (Fitzroya Patagonica) near Puerto Montt. The ragged and weather-worn stumps which remain are witnesses to the splendid size of the trees and the ruthless nature of their destruction. there is not a good tree left. Fortunately, the best timber is at present found in positions more remote from the coast. Alerce and cypress are valuable whenever they are found, and it may happen that with the growth of the means of access to the upper valleys of teh Andes, where they chiefly exist at present, will come a growth of appreciation of the necessity for forest reservations, and forest nurseries.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Chile,Latin America,South America
Concepcion,Concepción,-36.82013,-73.04439,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"From the harbour of Talcahuano it is a very short run by rail to the lovely old town of Concepcion. The Intendente, or Governor, of the town rightly judged that the best he could offer to the stranger was a view of Concepcion from the hills above; so, after disposing of the inevitable reception (and the invariable but trying ordeal by champagne), we rode out of the quaint old plaza, across the poplar avenue (more stately and yet more blessed in the grace of its surroundings than the poplar avenue of Islamabad in Kashmir) , and up the steep red slopes of the hills to where we might watch the Bio-Bio interlacing the plains (threaded with poplar and now blue with the shimmer of autumn haze), and curling itself lazily to the lip of the sea. It was a typical view of Central Chile. The town of Concepcion (square built, with straight streets intersecting) packed its white houses round the central Plaza, and extended broken arms out into the yellow plains beyond. On one side of it were the sunlit hills, red and purple, with dark blotches of broken forest; and we stood on an outlying spur of them looking a cross the town and over the river to the shining sea. Below us was the Bio-Bio bridge, which is 1,889 metres in length and was opened in the year of grace 1889- so we were told. It wore an unsubstantial look because its girders rested on trestles with no apparent abutments, or protecting piers, to break the force of what is at times an unruly river. It looked just a narrow ribbon of communication between the town and the port of Talcahuano.

In every town of Chile the banks seem to occupy the best sites and to rise to the greatest architectural magnificence. So it is in Concepcion. But the shops are good, and the Club (with eighty English members) was emphatic in its welcome and impressive in its hopes of a speedy termination to a condistion of ""armed peace"" which handicapped trade and paralysed enterprise.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Chile,Latin America,South America
Lota,Lota,-37.09205,-73.15458,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"Lota is the great centre of the coal and copper industry of Chile, and here enormous fortunes have been made. The copper smelting is accessory to the coal mining, for no copper from Chilean territory is smelted here. The ores (carbonates and sulphates) are brought down from California in ships, and here undergo a succession of refining processes.

But memories of Lota are entwined with other visions than those of roaring furnaces and vast mountains of unutilised slag. There was a garden above Lota, on the cliffs overlooking the bay, which had been laid out by a Chilean lady, who, determined to redeem the black ugliness of the coal fields from which she derived her fortune by following the suggestions of artistic fancy, devoted the declining years of her life to landscape gardening. Nothing repays the artist in Chile like the development of its natural beauty in landscape form. For miles one might wander through the lovely leafy avenues of these gardens, turning occasionally into open spaces where fountains and statues broke the chequered lights, or where masses of flowers piled themselves in banks and beds against the velvet slopes of cultured turf and never lose sight altogether of the glitter of the western sea as it faded in hazy distance to meet the sunset.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Chile,Latin America,South America
The straits of Patagonia,Nonspecific straits off Chile's coast,-51.60277,-74.80333,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"It was only by daylight that we slowly steamed along the course between the hills, which sometimes narrowed to a stone's throw and sometimes receded from each other and left space enough for the westerly winds to raise a white-topped sea. Cold and grey and misty was the usual condition of the atmosphere, but neither greyness nor mist could much affect the weird beauty of the endless procession of th e mountain scenery through which we glided and slid [...] Forest was everywhere about us, dense, shadowy, dark, and generally dripping. The long lines of the higher sierra were thick with it up to the point where the granite cliffs, polished and smoothed by ice-cap and glacier, gave foothold to vegetation only on their flat ledges. The little islets, that seemed to chase one another through the streaky grey sea, were rounded and packed with it [...] Sometimes there would come a break in the hills. Then one looked up the long blue vista of a valley, counting fold upon fold and spur upon spur, ever growing bluer and fainter in the distance, till a gleam of white shimmering light showed where the glacier lay at the end. Sometimes another inlet twisted out of the main course, running so deep into the heart of the hills that the head of it was lost to view. But the glacier made itself felt in the cold touch of the icy air which breathed from its mouth, and in the countless little white icebergs that tumbled along one after another round the curves of the inlet shore out into the open. Although it was difficult to imagine that anything so wet and so dripping as that prirmeval forest could ever make an effective blaze, still there were unmistakeable evidences of vast forest fires at intervals.","Thomas Hungerford Holdich, The Countries of the King's Award (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1904), Hathi Trust.",https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,Chile,Latin America,South America
The straits of Patagonia,Nonspecific straits off Chile's coast,-46.12948,-74.67571,Col. Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich,1902,"Along the immediate rim of the sea there were usually rocks and kelp and mussels and sea creatures of many sorts. Here we could climb along with difficulty; but the leaving of the hard rocks of the shore, and the thrusting of one's body into the close set jungle of undergrowth was a process much more difficult. The countless masses of growing things, and the rotten substratum of things that had done growing, made a most insecure footing. The deep spongy moss let one in knee deep even when it covered a hard rocky surface. When it merely hid a slimy mass of interlaced and rotten tree trunks there was no known depth to which one might not descend. It would be easy enough for a man to disappear bodily (as in an Irish bog) whilst still wandering under the shade of those forest trees. The result is that no living four-footed creature is to be found in Patagonian jungles near the sea; and sport, as known to the British sportsman, does not exist [...] Thick as is t h forest growth there is nothing on the islands which can be called good timber. A few ""canoe"" Indians find there home in these still waters, punting from one small bay to another, and subsisting on the mussels (choros) and sea eggs which cluster thick on the rocky edges of the land. Immense ""middens,"" or mounds of cast-away shells, testify to a far more extensive Indian occupation than now exists, and all nautical wanderers through these by-ways of the sea speak of the rapid diminuation of the ancient coast tribes.

 The houses of Gaeta are very handsome to look at outside ; they are very high, with windows towards the sea.
 
 The finest street is that which runs parallel to the sea, the others being steep, narrow, and bad for walking. In the chief street there is much merchandise, and the city has a considerable trade during the whole year.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Not far from this church there is a fissure made in the rock, about ten brazas in depth, and fifty paces long, and so narrow that only one man could get into it at a time; and a hermit lives there named Santa Cruz.

From this place they saw the edifices of Troy, with parts of the wall, having doors at intervals, and towers, and other buildings like castles.

Tenia,Tenedos,39.82051,26.03571,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"The island of Tenia, which is opposite the said city, used to be the port of the city, to which ships resorted. It was occupied by king Priam, who built a great castle on it, called Tenedos, for the defence of the shipping. This island used to be full of inhabitants, but it is now deserted. The boat was sent from the ship to procure water and wood, and some of the attendants of the embassy went to see the island, and found many vineyards and fruit trees, and game such as partridges and rabbits, and the ruins of a great castle.
 
 The reason why this island of Tenia is uninhabited, is as follows:-About twenty-two years ago, the emperor of Constantinople promised to give the said island to the Genoese, for assisting him with some galleys in his war against the Turk; but he afterwards sold it to the Venetians, who settled on it, and fortified the town and castle. When the Genoese heard this, they declared that the island belonged to them, and that the emperor had promised it to them, and that he had no right to sell it to any one.
 
 Thus there was discord between the Genoese and Venetians, and they both began to arm their feets, and committed great slaughter amongst each other, upon this island. Peace was made on condition that neither should have it; that the town and castle should be laid in ruins, and that the island should be left uninhabited. This is one of the causes why, at this day, there is enmity between the Genoese and Venetians.
 
 On Sunday afternoon a vessel arrived in the port of Tenio, and they sent to ask where she came from. She was from Gallipoli, a place belonging to the Turk, but on Grecian land, and was bound for Chios, with a cargo of wheat; and she brought news that a great pestilence raged at Gallipoli.
 
 The ambassadors were detained for thirteen days more, owing to the foul wind ; and from the said island of Tenio they could see a very high mountain called Monteston, which is in the land of Greece, and where there is a monastery of Greek monks, who lead very holy lives, and will not allow a woman, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor any tame thing which has young, to come near them : and they do not eat meat. This monastery is very rich, and they say that it is two days journey from the foot of the mountain to the summit, where the monastery stands; and, besides this one, there are fifty or sixty monasteries, where the monks all dress in black, and do not drink wine, nor eat meat, nor oil, nor fish, with blood ; and these things were related by some Greeks who were in the said ship, who had lived some time on that holy mountain.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

A year and a half ago they say that eight Genoese galleys arrived, and plundered the town. The castle is called “ the end of the roads;"" and when the Greeks came from their country to destroy the city of Troy, they had their camp in this castle, and in front of it the Greeks made some great caves, leading towards Troy; three in number.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Constantinople,Istanbul,41.00823,28.97835,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"Though the city is so large, it is not all well peopled, for in the middle of it there are many enclosures, where there are corn fields, and fruit gardens. The most populous part is near the sea ; and the greatest traffic is from the city, by the gates which open on the sea, especially the gates leading to the city of Pera, on account of the ships which go there to unload ; and because those of both cities pass from the one to the other, with their merchandise.
 
 This city of Constantinople contains many great churches and monasteries, but most of them are in ruins ; though it seems clear that, in former times, when the city was in its youth, it was the most renowned city in the world. They say that even now there are three thousand churches, large and small; and within the city there are fountains and wells of sweet water ; and in a part below the church which is dedicated to the Holy Apostle, there is a bridge reaching from one valley to another, over houses and gardens, by which water used to come, for the irrigation of those gardens.
 ...
 The city of Constantinople is near the sea, as you have been told, and two sides face the sea; and in front is the city of Pera. Between the two cities is the port, and Constantinople is thus like Seville, and Pera is like Triana, with the port and the ships between them; and the Greeks do no call it Constantinople as we do, but Escomboli.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Church of St. John the Baptist,Hirami Ahmet Pasha Mosque,41.02791,28.9459,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"The first thing they went to see, was the church of St. John the Baptist, which they call St. John of the stone, and which is near the emperor's palace. On the top of the first doorway of this church there was a very rich figure of St. John, well designed in mosaic; and near this doorway there was a lofty capital, raised on four arches; and the roof and walls are covered with beautiful images and figures in mosaic. This mosaic work is made of very small stones, which are covered with fine gilt, and blue, white, green, or red enamel, according to the colour which is required to depict the figures, so that this work is very marvellous to behold. 
 Beyond this place there is a great court, surrounded by houses, and containing many cypress trees: and opposite the door into the body of the church there is a beautiful fountain, under a canopy raised upon eight white marble pillars, and the pipe of the fountain is of white stone. The body of the church is very lofty, and near the entrance there are three small chapels, each containing an altar, and the door of the centre chapel is plated with silver ; and by the side of the door there are four marble columns inlaid with small jaspers, and silver crosses, and precious stones : and there are curtains of silk across these doors, placed there that the priest may not be seen when he goes in to say mass. The roof is very rich, and inlaid with mosaics. On the roof of the body of the church there is a figure of God the Father ; and the walls are inlaid in the same manner nearly to the ground; and the floor is enriched with jaspers. The chapel was surrounded by seats of carved wood, and between each chair there was a brazier with ashes, into which the people spit, that they may not spit on the ground; and there are many lamps of silver and of glass.
 
 There are many relics in this church, of which the emperor keeps the key. On this day the ambassadors were shown the left arm of St. John the Baptist, from the shoulder to the hand. This arm was withered, so that the skin and bone alone remained, and the joints of the elbow and the hand were adorned with jewels set in gold. This church also contains many relics of Jesus Christ; but the ambassadors were not shown them on that day, because the emperor had gone out hunting, and had left the keys of the church with the empress, but he forgot to give her the keys of the place where these relics were kept. But on another day they were shown, as will presently be related. This church belongs to a monastery, and the monks have a very large hall, in the middle of which there is a table of white marble, thirty paces long, and there are many wooden seats round it; and there are three other small tables. Within the precincts of this monastery there are gardens, and vineyards, and other things which there is not space to describe.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Chuch and Monestery of St. Mary Peribleptos,Church of St. George of Samatya,41.00189,28.93274,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"The same day they went to see another church called Peribelico, dedicated to St. Mary. At the entrance to this church there is a great court, containing many cypresses, walnut trees, elms, and other trees. The outer walls of the church are covered with images and other figures, in gold, blue, and other colours. On the left hand side of the entrance to the church there are many figures, and amongst them an image of St. Mary, with one of the emperor and another of the empress on each side. At the feet of the image of St. Mary there are representations of thirty castles and cities, with the names of Grecian cities written under them. They say that these cities and castles formerly belonged to this church, having been given by an emperor called Romanus, who lies interred here. At the feet of the image there were certain documents written in steel, and sealed with seals of wax and lead, which described the privileges enjoyed by this church over those cities and castles.
 
 There are five altars in the body of the church; which is very large and lofty, supported on pillars of various coloured marble, and the walls and floor are inlaid with jasper; and the ceiling is inlaid with very rich mosaics. On the left hand side, at the end of the church, there is a handsome stone monument, where the body of the emperor Romanus is interred: they said that this monument was formerly covered with gold and precious stones, but that when the Latins captured this city, ninety years ago, they plundered this tomb.
 
 In this church there is another great stone tomb, in which another emperor is interred, and this church also contains the other arm of the blessed St. John the Baptist, which was shown to the ambassadors. This was the right arm, and it was fresh and healthy ; and, though they say that the whole body of the blessed St. John was destroyed, except one finger of the right arm, with which he pointed when he said “ Ecce Agnus Dei,” yet certainly the whole of this arm was fresh and in good preservation, but it wanted the thumb. [There is another paragraph about the thumb involving a dragon.]
 In this same church they were shown a small cross, a palmo in length, ornamented with gold, with a small crucifix and it was placed in a recess which was covered with gold, so that it could be taken out and replaced at pleasure. They say that it is made of the wood of the true cross, on which our Lord Jesus Christ was placed, and its colour is black.
 
 Outside the church there is a cloister, where there are many beautiful representations of history, among which is the root of Jesse, showing the lineage whence came the blessed Virgin Mary. It was figured in mosaic; and was so wonderful, so rich, and so well drawn, that it surpassed all the other works. There are many monks belonging to the church, who showed the above things to the ambassadors and also took them into a very large and lofty refectory, in the midst of which there was a table of white marble, very well made, being thirty-five palmos long, and the floor was of marble flags. At the end of this refectory there were two small tables of white marble, and the ceiling was covered with mosaic work; and on the walls pictures were represented in mosaic work, from the salutation of the blessed Virgin Mary by St. Gabriel, to the birth of Jesus Christ our God, together with his journeys with his disciples, and all his blessed life, until he was crucified. In this refectory there were many flag stones, made to place meat and other food upon ; and in the monastery there were many cells, where the monks live ; and gardens, and water, and vineyards, so that this monastery is like a large town.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Hippodrome,Sultanahmet Square,41.00632,28.9757,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"On another day the ambassadors went to see a plain called the Hippodrome, where they joust. It is surrounded by white marble pillars, so large that three men can only just span round them, and their height is two lances. They are thirty-seven in number, fixed in very large white marble bases ; and above, they were connected by arches going from one to the other, so that a man can walk all round, on the top of them; and there are battlements, breast high, of white marble, and these are made for ladies, and maidens, and noble women, when they view the jousts and tournaments which are celebrated here. In front of these seats, there is a row of pillars, on which is a high seat, raised on four marble pillars, surrounded by other seats, and at each corner there are four images of white marble, the size of a man; and the emperor is accustomed to sit here, when he views the tournaments. Near these pillars, there are two blocks of white marble, one on the top of the other, of great size, each one being the height of a lance, or more; and on the top of these blocks there are four square blocks of copper.
 
 On the top of these blocks there is an immense stone, sharp at the end, at least six lances in height. It is not fixed in any way; so that it was marvellous to think how so great a mass of stone, yet so sharp and fine, could have been placed there. It is so high that it may be seen above the city, from the sea. This column has been placed there in memory of some great event; and on the base there is an inscription, announcing who it was who caused this stone to be placed there, and for what reason ; but as the writing was in Greek, and it was getting late, the ambassadors could not wait to have it read to them. But they say that it was raised to commemorate some great deed. Beyond it the range of columns continues, though they are not so high as the first, and the deeds of the knights are painted on them ; and between these columns there are three copper figures of serpents. They are twisted like a rope, and they have three heads, with open mouths. It is said that these figures of serpents were put here, on account of an enchantment which was effected. The city used to be infested by many serpents, and other evil animals, which killed and poisoned men ; but an emperor performed an enchantment over these figures, and serpents have never done any harm to the people of the city, since that time.
 
 The plain is very large, and is surrounded by steps, one rising above the other to a considerable height; and these steps are made for the people of the city; and below them there are great houses, with doors opening on the plain, where the knights who are going to joust are accustomed to arm and disarm.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

St. Sophia (Church),Hagia Sophia,41.00858,28.98017,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"On the same day the ambassadors went to see the church which is called St. Sophia, which is the largest, most honoured, and most privileged of all the churches in the city; and it has canons who do duty as if it was a cathedral, and a patriarch, whom the Greeks call Marpollit.
 
 In a court, in front of the church, there are nine very large white marble pillars, the largest I ever beheld, and it is said that a great palace used to stand on the top of them, where the patriarch and his clergy held their meetings. In this same court, in front of the church, a wonderfully high stone column stands, on the top of which there is a horse made of copper, of the size of four large horses put together; and on its back there is the figure of an armed knight, also of copper, with a great plume on his head, resembling the tail of a peacock. The horse has chains of iron round its body, secured to the column, to prevent it from falling, or being moved by the wind. This horse is very well made, and one fore and one hind leg is raised, as if it was in the act of prancing. The knight, The knight, on its back, has his right arm raised, with the hand open, while the reins are held with the left This column, horse, and knight, are so large and high, that it is wonderful to see them. This marvellous horse is said to have been placed here by the Emperor Justinian, who erected the column, and performed great and notable deeds against the Turks, in his time.
 
 At the entrance to this church, under an arch, there is a small but very rich and beautiful chapel, raised upon four marble columns; and opposite this chapel is the door of the church. It is very large and high, and covered with brass, and in front of it there is a small court, containing some high terraces ; beyond which there is another door covered with brass, like the first. Within this door there is a broad and lofty nave, with a ceiling of wood, and on the left hand there are very large and well built cloisters, adorned with slabs of marble and jasper of various colours. The body of are of the church contains five lofty doors, all covered with brass, and the centre one is the largest. The body of the church is the loftiest, most rich, and most beautiful that can be seen in the whole world. It is surrounded by three large and broad naves, which are joined to it, so that mass may be heard in all parts of the church. The arches of the naves green jasper, and unite the roofs of the nave with that of the body of the church; but the summit of the latter rises much higher than that of the naves. It is dome shaped, and very high, so that a man must have good eyes who looks up from beneath ; and the church is one hundred and five paces long, by ninety-three broad; and the dome is supported by four pillars, very large and thick, covered with flags of many coloured jaspers ; and from pillar to pillar there are arches of green jasper, which are very high and sustain the dome. In the arches there are four very large slabs, two on the right hand and two on the left, which are coloured with a substance made from a powder, artificially, and called porphyry. The dome is covered with very rich mosaic work, and, over the high altar, the image of God the Father, very large, is wrought in mosaics of many colours; but it is so high up, that it only looks about the size of a man, or a little larger, though really it is so large that it measures three palmos between the eyes; but to him who looks at it, it does not appear to be more nor less than a man, and that is owing to the very great height it is placed above the ground.
 
 On the floor, in the centre of the part under the dome, there is a pulpit placed on four columns of jasper ; and the sides of it are covered with flags of jasper ; and this pulpit is surmounted by a capital, raised on eight very large jasper columns; and here they preach, and also say the gospel on feast days. The walls and floor of the church are lined with flags of jasper, worked all over with ornaments, very beautiful to behold. The part between the arches, which supports the dome, was of very handsome white stone, on which many appropriate figures were inlaid, and above that there was very rich mosaic. The arched roofs of the naves surrounded the dome, except where the high altar stood, all which was worth seeing. The said arched roofs were ninety paces broad, and four hundred and ten paces round, and they were beautifully inlaid with mosaics. In the wall, on the left hand side, there is a very large white slab, on which, among many other figures, was drawn, very naturally, without any human artifice of sculpture or painting, the most sacred and blessed Virgin Mary, with our Lord Jesus Christ in her most holy arms, with his most glorious forerunner, St. John the Baptist, on one side. These images, as I said before, are not drawn, or painted with any colour, or inlaid ; but the stone itself gave birth to this picture, with its veins, which may be clearly seen ; and they say that when this stone was cut, to be placed in this most holy place, the workmen saw these most wonderful and fortunate images on it, and, as this church was the most important one in the city, that stone was deposited in it. The said images appear as if they were in the clouds of heaven, and as if there was a thin veil before them.
 
 This appeared most wonderful, as a thing which God himself had shown; and at the foot of these images there is an altar, and a small chapel, in which they say mass ; and in this church was shown the holy body of a patriarch, which was entire, both in bone and flesh.
 
 The ambassadors were also shown the gridiron on which the blessed St. Lawrence was roasted; and in the church of St. Sophia there are vaults and cisterns, and subterranean chambers, which are strange things, wonderful to see. Near the church there are many fallen edifices, and doors leading to the church, closed and ruined. In the church there is a very large cistern under ground, capable of floating ten galleys. All these works, and many others in this church, were shown, so that they can neither be related nor written briefly; and so great is the edifice, and the wonderful works in the church are so numerous, that they take a long time to see. The roofs are all covered with lead. This church is privileged, and any person, either Greek or of any other nation, who commits a crime, either of robbery or murder, and takes refuge here, may not be taken hence.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Santa Maria de la Cherne,Church of St. Mary of the Spring,41.00671,28.91579,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"1st of November, the ambassadors went to Constantinople, and soon found Master Ilario, and others of the household of the emperor, at the gate of Quinigo, where they were waiting. They then mounted on horseback, and went to see a church called “ Santa Maria de la Cherne,” which is within the city, and opposite to a ruined castle, which used to be a lodging, used by the emperors. The said castle was destroyed by an emperor, because he found his son in it, in a manner that will be related to you presently.
 
 This church of Santa Maria de la Cherne"" used to be a chapel of the emperor's, and the interior consists of three naves, the centre one being the largest and most lofty, and the other two being lower. They are vaulted, and the arches connect them together. These naves are adorned in the following manner. They are raised on great pillars of green jasper, and their bases are of white marble, inlaid with many figures. The ceilings and the walls, half way up, are covered with flags of jasper of many colours, with many figures and beautiful works artificially wrought upon them.
 
 The ceiling of the centre nave is very rich, made of timber in squares and beams, all gilded with very fine gold; and though parts of the church were much out of repair, this gilded ceiling looked as fresh and as beautiful as if it was just finished. In the centre nave there was a rich altar and a pulpit, also very rich; and all the furniture of the church is very rich and costly, and the roof was all covered with lead.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Pera,Beyoğlu,41.03828,28.97033,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1403,"In a street which leads to one of the gates of the city, opposite Pera, there is a pair of stocks fixed in the ground, for men who are to be imprisoned, or who break any of the city regulations, or who sell meat or bread with false weights.
 
 Such persons are taken to this place, and left there day and night, exposed to the weather. Between the city walls and the sea, opposite Pera, there are many houses, in which many things are sold, and warehouses.
 
 Pera is a small city, but well peopled and surrounded with a wall, and it contains good and handsome houses. It is inhabited by Genoese, and is a lordship of Genoa. It is peopled by Genoese and Greeks, and is so close to the sea, that between the wall and the water there is not sufficient breadth for a carrack to pass. The wall runs along the shore, and then ascends a hill, on the top of which there is a great tower, whence the city is watched. This hill, however, is not so high as another outside the town, which rises above it; and on that eminence the Turk encamped when he besieged Pera and Constantinople, and here they fought, and hurled missiles from engines. The Turk twice assaulted the city, and blockaded it by sea and land for six months, with four hundred thousand men on land, and sixty galleons and ships by sea; but they were unable to enter, nor even to occupy a suburb, so that it seems that the Turks are not good combatants, as they could not enter.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Formerly a chain was stretched from one tower to the other, and when the land on both sides belonged to the Greeks, these castles were used to guard this strait ; and any vessel passing from the greater sea to Pera and Constantinople, or from Pera to the sea, was stopped by a chain stretched across from one castle to the other, and was thus detained until the dues were paid.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Sea,Black Sea,41.3218,29.17404,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"The reason why this sea is so dangerous is that it is round, and three thousand miles in circuit, and it has only one entrance, namely the strait near the city of Pera. It is surrounded by very high mountains, and many great rivers fall into it. The sea boils and rises into great waves, when the wind springs up. This sea is also dangerous because, when ships approach the strait, it is very difficult to know it, and if they miss it, they go on shore and are lost, as has happened many times; also, if when the strait is made out, and the vessel is near it, any of the gales arise, she is in danger of being driven on shore, and in this manner a vessel was lately lost which was coming from Caffa.""","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

 The city of Trebizond is built near the sea, and its wall rises up over some rocks, and on the highest part there is a very strong castle, which has another wall round it. A small river passes by the castle, and dashes over the rocks, and on this side the city is very strong, but on the other side it is on open ground. Outside the city walls there are suburbs, and the most beautiful part is a street near the sea, which is in one of these suburbs, where they sell all the things required in the city. On the shore there are two castles, with strong walls and towers, one belonging to the Venetians and the other to the Genoese, and they hold them with the consent of the emperor.
 
 Outside the city, there are many churches and monasteries. In this city the Armenians have a church and a bishop, and they consecrate the body of God in the same way as the Catholics; but the priest, when he dresses, does not put the stole with the cross on his breast, and when he reads the gospel, he turns his face to the people.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

This city was in a plain, and on one side flowed the great river called Corras; and on the other there was a very deep and rocky valley, as broad as the flight of an arrow; and it encircled the city, until it united with the river. The valley and river made the city very strong, so that it could only be attacked where the river commenced; but at this place there was a very strong castle, with great towers, and it had two gates, one in front of the other. This city of Calmarin was the first city that was built in the world, after the flood, and it was built by the lineage of Noah. The people of the city said that, eight years ago, Tetani, Emperor of Tartary, besieged the city, and that they fought day and night for two days, and on the third there was a parley. They gave up the city, on condition that neither he, nor his people should enter it, but that the citizens should pay to him a certain annual tribute ; with which the emperor was satisfied, but he demanded that half the people of the city should be given up to him, to go with him to the land of Jugania,' where he was going to make war on the king Sorso. When the citizens had given up these men, the emperor attacked the city, entered it by force, pillaged and burnt it, making breaches in the walls, and killing many people.
 
 The greater part of the inhabitants were Armenians ; but the land of Armenia has been taken from the Christians by the Moors, as I will relate to you, presently. In this city there are very great edifices; and throughout all this country, they gave the ambassadors and their people lodging, and food, and horses; for all the land belonged to Timour Beg.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Mountain of the ark of Noah,Mount Ararat,39.70243,44.29907,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Saturday, the 13th of May, the road led along the foot of the mountain of the ark of Noah. It was very high, and the summit was covered with snow, and it was without woods; but there was much herbage upon it, and many streams. Near the road there were many edifices, and foundations of houses, of stone; and great quantities of rye was growing, as if it had been sown by man, but it was useless, and did not come to grain ; and there was also plenty of water cresses. At the foot of this mountain they came to the ruins of a town long since deserted, which was a league in length ; and the people of the country said that it was the first town that was built in the world, after the flood, and that it was founded by Noah and his sons.
 
 After leaving these ruins, they came to a great plain, in which there were many streams of water, and trees, and rose gardens, and fountains.
 
 The mountain had a very sharp peak, which was covered with snow, and they say that the snow never leaves this peak all the year round, either in winter or summer, and this is on account of its great height.
 
 On this day the ambassadors took their siesta by a beautiful fountain, near a stone arch; and while they were there, the clouds moved away, and the peak of the mountain appeared, but they suddenly returned, and the people said that it was very seldom visible.
 
 Next to this mountain, there was another, which also had a sharp peak, but not so high as the first, and between these two peaks there is one like a saddle, and they were all very high, and their summits were all covered with snow.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Tabreez,Tabriz,38.07918,46.28867,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Wednesday, the 11th of June, at the hour of vespers, they arrived at the great city of Tabreez. This city is in a plain, between two high ranges of hills. It is not walled, and the hills on the left hand are very near the city, and are very hot, and the water which descends from them is not wholesome ; but those on the right hand are more distant, and they are very cold and capped with snow, and the water which descends from them is very good. These streams come down to the city, and flow through it in various directions.
 
 In the range of hills, opposite the city, there are two high rocks, which used to be united, but every year they move further from each other. In the range on the left hand side there is a high hill, which, they say, was once bought by the Genoese, from a ruler whose name was Sultan Veis, for the purpose of building a castle upon it. They add, that after it was sold, he changed his mind, and, when the Genoese wished to build the castle, he sent for them, and told them that it was not the custom for merchants to build castles in his country. He said that they might take their merchandize away, and that if they wanted to build a castle, they might move the hill out of his territory. When they answered him, he ordered their heads to be cut off.
 
 From the range of hills on the right hand, a great river descends towards the city, and is divided into many channels, which flow through the streets. In this city there are many well ordered streets and lanes, where they sell many things.
 
 In some of the streets there are very large buildings, with many doors, within which are shops, and there are officers who keep order. From these buildings there are gateways leading to certain streets, where they sell many things, such as cloth, silk, cotton, tafeta, and other stuffs ; and this city has a great trade.
 
 In one place, in these buildings, there are certain men who sell many kinds of scents and pigments for women; and the women come themselves to buy them, and they paint and anoint themselves. These women go about, covered all over with a white sheet, with a net, made of black horse hair, before their eyes, and thus they are concealed, so that no one can recognize them, In this city there are many grand edifices, especially mosques, which are ornamented very skilfully with mosaics, and blue and gold work, made in Greece. They say that these great works were made by very rich men, who were jealous of each other, and each strove to erect the most wonderful work, and in this way they spent their wealth.
 
 Amongst these edifices there was a great house, which was surrounded by a wall, very beautiful and rich, in which there are twenty thousand chambers and apartments; and they say that this house was built by a ruler of Persia, named Sultan Veis; with the treasure that was paid him, as tribute, by the Sultan of Babylon. He called this house Tolbatgana, which means “ the house of fortune.” This house is well built.
 
 The city of Tabreez is very large and rich, owing to the quantity of merchandize that passes through it, every day.

Inside there were large houses and mosques, and streams of water flowed through the streets.
 
 This was the chief city of the dominions of Darius, and the one which he liked best, and in which he resided most; and from this place he marched forth, to fight Alexander.

Sultanieh,Soltaniyeh,36.43398,48.79464,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Thursday, the 22nd of June, at noon, they arrived at the great city of Sultanieh, where they found Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg. On Friday morning they went to see the said Miran Meerza; and as it is the custom for every one who goes to see him, to give him some thing, the ambassadors brought some cloth, and other things.
 
 They found him in a palace, where there was a large fruit garden, full of armed men ; and he received them very well, and invited them into a tent where he was sitting, asking them after the health of the lord our king.
 
 After they had talked for a long time, they were asked to eat, and the ambassadors ate according to their custom, and, when they wished to go away, they were given some robes to dress in.
 
 This city of Sultanieh is in a plain, and has no wall; but it has a castle with strong walls, and handsome towers, and all the towers and walls were ornamented with patterns, and each tower had a small catapult on the top.
 
 This city is very populous, but it is not so large as Tabreez, though it possesses more trade. Every year, especially in the months of June, July, and August, very large caravans of camels arrive, with great quantities of merchandize. They mean the same as we do by the word caravan, namely, a drove of beasts. This city has a great traffic, and yields a large revenue to the lord. Every year many merchants come here from India, with spices, such as cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, manna, mace, and other precious articles, which do not go to Alexandria. Also all the silk which is made in Gheelan comes here, and Gheelan is a province near the sea of Bakou, where much silk is made every year. This silk of Gheelan is sent to Damascas, and Syria, and Turkey, and many other countries. Also there arrives all the silk which is made in the province of Xamahi, and merchants come here for silk, even Venetians and Genoese.
 
 This land is so hot that when any foreign merchant is struck by the sun, he is killed; and they say that when the sun strikes any one, it presently penetrates to his heart and kills him, burning his back very much; and those who escape, almost always remain quite yellow, and never return to their proper colour.
 
 There also arrive in this city many silken cloths, cottons, tafetas, and other stuffs from a land called Shiraz, which is near India, and from Yesen, and Serpi ; and from Khorassan there come cotton threads, and cotton cloths, woven in many colours. This land of Khorassan is a great territory, which extends from Tartary to India. Many precious stones also arrive in this city of Sultanieh. From Cathay vessels come within sixty days journey of this city, having navigated the western sea, which is the sea which bounds this land; and they come to a river, which is ten days journey from the city of Ormuz. The ships and boats which navigate this sea have no iron; but their timbers are joined with cords and wooden pegs; for if they were united with iron, they would soon be torn to pieces by the loadstones, of which there are many in that sea. These ships bring many pearls, and some of them bring rubies, (which are very fine in Cathay), and much spice; and from Ormuz these things are sent to all parts of the world.
 
 Most of the pearls are found in that sea of China, and they bring them to the city of Ormuz, to be pierced and cut; and the Moorish and Christian merchants say that they know of no place where the pearls can be pierced, except this city of Ormuz. The city of Sultanieh is sixty days journey from the city of Ormuz. They also say that these pearls are formed in large shells, which they call jacares; and those who come from Cathay, and from Ormuz, say that the pearl is formed in the shells, which are large, and as white as paper. Theybring them to this city of Sultanieh, and to Tabreez, where they make girdles and rings of them.
 
 All the merchants who come from the land of the Christians, from Caffa, and Trebizond, and the merchants of Turkey and Syria, come every year, at this time, to the city of Sultanieh, to make their purchases. This city is situated in a plain, and many channels of water pass through it, and in it there are many well ordered streets, where the people sell their merchandize. In this city there are several large inns, where the merchants lodge. The city is surrounded by very extensive and populous plains ; and on the right hand there are some mountains, and beyond them is a land called Koordistan. These mountains are very wild, and there is snow upon them all the year round. On the left hand there is another range of hills, which are very hot, and behind them is the province of Gheelan, and the sea of Bakou,' which is surrounded by land, and is not connected with any other sea whatever; and it is six days journey from Sultanieh to the sea of Bakou. Diamonds are found, on some islands in the sea of Bakou. Snow never falls in the land of Gheelan, because it is so hot; and it produces many citrons, lemons, and oranges.
 
 The city of Sultanieh has a great traffic, and yields a large yearly revenue to the lord ; and this city, with Tabreez, and the empire of Persia, was formerly governed by Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg, but he has been deprived, for the following reasons :-Miran Meerza, being the ruler of this land, had many knights with him, and a large army, which his father had given him. Being in the city of Tabreez, he ordered a great number of houses, mosques, and fine buildings to be destroyed, and many were pulled down.
 
 He then went to Sultanieh, ordered the same to be done there, took his father's treasure out of the castle, and divided it amongst his followers. Outside the city, a little apart, there was a very fine edifice, built by a great knight, who lies interred within it. Miran Meerza ordered this also to be destroyed, and the body of the great knight to be cast out. [...]

Teheran,Tehran,35.72185,51.33469,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Saturday they were provided with post horses, and set out at night. On Sunday, the 6th of July, at noon, they came to a city called Teheran, where they found Baba Sheikh, who came out to receive them, and conducted them to a lodging, which was used by the lord when he was there, and which was the largest in the city.
 
 On Monday the said knight sent for the ambassadors, and, when they were near his house, he came out to meet them, and sat down in a room with them, Presently he sent for the ambassador of the Sultan of Babylon, who had arrived with presents for Timour Beg, and gave him many dishes of meat to eat, which had been prepared ; amongst which was a horse roasted with its head. After they had eaten, the knight said to them that, on another day, they should go and visit a great Meerza, who was son-in-law to the lord.
 
 When the ambassadors were going to depart, he gave Ruy Gonzalez a dress, and a hat, and said that he was to accept them as a token of the friendship which Timour Beg felt for his king.
 
 This city of Teheran was very large, but it had no walls, and it was a very delightful place, well supplied with everything ; but it was an unhealthy place, according to the natives, and fevers were very prevalent. The territory in which it stands is called Rei, which is a great and extensive lordship, possessed by the son-in-law of the lord.
 
 The road from Sultanieh to Teheran is very level, and the country is populous, and very hot.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Damghan,Damghan,36.16292,54.33398,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Thursday they reached a great city, on the banks of a river, and two deserted castles.
 
 On Thursday, the 17th of July, in the night, they arrived at a city which is called Damghan, situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall, with a castle at one end.
 
 This city is in the province of Media. On this day it was so hot, with a hot fierce wind, that it was quite wonderful.
 
 The wind was so hot, that it seemed as if it came out of hell; and on this day a ger falcon escaped, and flew away.
 
 Outside the city there were two towers, so high that a man could scarcely throw a stone to the top of them. They were made of mud, and the heads of men; and there were air ;two other towers, fallen to the ground. These towers, which are made of heads, are built of the heads of a race of people called “white Tartars,” natives of a country between Turkey and Syria. When Timour Beg departed from Sebastria, and marched towards Damascus, he encountered these people, fought, and conquered them ; taking many prisoners, and sending them to settle at Damghan, which was thinly populated. When they arrived there, they collected together, and lived in the plains, as was their custom. When they were all assembled, they desired to return to their native land, and they set out on their journey, robbing every one they met. When they were near this city, the army of the lord met them, defeated them, and killed them without mercy. The lord then ordered that these four towers should be built, of their heads, plastered together with mud. He also ordered that every white Tartar, wherever he might be found, should be put to death, and so it was done. The army, when they received this order, killed every white Tartar they could find; so that along the roads, in one place ten, in another twenty dead bodies might be seen, and they say that sixty thousand of these Tartars were killed. The people of the city say, that they often see lights burning on the top of these towers in the night.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Jagaro,Jajarm,36.95171,56.37359,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Tuesday, the 22nd of July, they slept at a city called Jagaro, and the day was very hot. This city was in a plain, at the foot of a mountain, without trees, and large pipes lead water from the mountain to the city. In the middle of the city there is a castle, on the top of a mound of earth, and the city had no wall of any kind. In the previous winter there was much snow, and when the summer came, it melted ; and so much water came down the pipes that it ruined the castle, and several houses. The road was very level, and there was not a single stone to be found on it; and the country was very hot, and with little water.
 
 When they arrived, they were given plenty of meat, and fresh horses; and they set out again with the knight whom the great lord had sent, who provided them with food, and with all that they required ; and gave them fresh horses every day, that they might travel faster. The lord had horses waiting at the end of each day's journey, at some places one hundred, and at others two hundred ; and thus the posts were arranged, on the road, as far as Samarcand. Those whom the lord sent in any direction, or who were sent to him, went on these horses as fast as they could, day and night.
 
 [...]
 
 Not only was this road thus supplied with post horses, but there were messengers on all the roads ; so that news could come from every province, in a few days. The lord is better pleased with him who travels a day and night for fifty leagues, and kills two horses, than with him who does the distance in three days.
 
 The great lord, considering that the leagues were very long, in his empire of Samarcand, divided each league into two, and placed small pillars on the roads, to mark each league; ordering all his Zagatays to march twelve, or at least ten of these leagues, in each day's journey. They call these leagues moles, because these turrets, which he caused to be built at the end of each league, and these leagues, the length of which he regulated, are in a country which is called Mogolia. The ambassadors travelled in the country, and saw the pillars, and each of the leagues was equal to two leagues of Castille.
 
 In truth it would scarcely be believed, unless it was actually seen, the distances which these fellows travel, each day and night; for they ride as far as their horses can carry them; and they do not only travel the distance which the lord has ordered, but they sometimes go over fifteen and twenty leagues in a day and night, without any consideration for the toil of their horses. When their horses are knocked up, they kill and sell them, if they are in an inhabited country; but we found many dead horses on the road, which had been killed by hard riding.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

 When they had dined, they departed with fresh horses, and travelled all night. On Friday, near noon, they reached a deserted village; but the people brought them food, and all they required, from another village, distant about half a league. At the hour of vespers they set out again, and travelled all night, along a very level road.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Nishapore,Neyshabur,36.21319,58.79427,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Saturday, the 26th of July, they arrived at a great city, which is called Nishapore; and before they reached it, at a distance of about a league, they crossed some great plains, where many streams of water were conducted to numerous fruit gardens, and in these plains they found as many as four hundred tents pitched. These tents were not made in the usual way, but they were long, and of black cloth, and a people called Alabares lived in them.
 
 These people do not possess anything but their tents, and they do not live in cities or villages, but in the open plains, as well in winter as in summer. They have large flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, besides twenty thousand camels.
 
 They wander, with their flocks and herds, over all the territory of the lord, and pay a yearly tribute of three thousand camels and fifteen thousand sheep to him, for the right of grazing in his territory. When the ambassadors came to their tents, the chief came out, and led them to a tent, and gave them much milk and cream, according to their custom.
 
 They departed from the tents, and set out for the city, but Gomez de Salazar was left behind in a village, very ill, as he could not travel any longer.
 
 The city of Nishapore is in a plain, and is surrounded by gardens, and very handsome houses. The ambassadors were conducted to very fine lodgings, and the chiefs of the city came to them with meat, and fruit, amongst which were very large and good melons, and also they sent them much wine.
 
 After they had eaten, they were presented with a robe, as it was the order of the lord that, whenever they arrived at a city, they should either be presented with a robe or a horse.
 
 This city is very large, and well supplied with all things.
 
 It is the chief city of Media, and here they find torquoises, and, though they are met with in other places, those of Nishapore are the best that are known. They are found in the earth, near a river which descends from a mountain, above the city. The neighbourhood is very populous, and fertile. Here the land of Media ends, and the land of Khorassan commences, which is a great empire.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

On account of this tomb, the city is crowded with pilgrims, who come here in great numbers every year.
 
 When the pilgrims arrive, they dismount, and kiss the ground, saying that they have reached a holy place.

Plain near a river,Plain near a river,36.83362,66.02415,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Thursday afternoon they departed, and slept amongst some tents of the Zagatays, in a plain, near the banks of a river. These Zagatays have received the privilege from the lord, to go where they like for pasture for their flocks and herds, as well in summer as in winter; and they serve the lord in his wars, whenever they are called for. They do not leave their women, children, and flocks behind, when they go to the wars, but take them all with them. The women, who have little children, when they travel, carry them in small cradles before them, on their horses, and they tie these cradles with broad bands, which they fasten round their waists; and thus they travel with their children, and ride as light as if they were without them. The poor people carry their children and tents on camels, and this way of travelling is very wearisome for the children, as the camels go very uneasily. Not only do these people, whom we met on the road, live in these plains ; but there are a vast number of others, for, when we found some in any place, many others also appeared, in one part or another, and so we travelled amongst them. Near towns, and places where there was water and pasture, we met many of them, and they were so burnt by the sun, that they looked as if they had come out of hell. This country was very flat, and very hot, and most of the troops who followed the lord, travelled by night; and the ambassadors remained amongst these tents of the Zagatays, until night. 
 
 On Friday, at noon, they came to a village, where they dined, and took their siesta. In the night they arrived at a great city, the name of which I have forgotten, but it was very large, and formerly it was walled, but now the wall is fallen, and most of the city is deserted, and in this city there were great edifices and mosques. The ambassadors were here presented with robes, and received with great honour.

The second was inhabited ; and the third was well peopled; and, though the other cities we had seen were without walls, this one was well provided with them.

great river called the Viadme,The Oxus River (Amu Darya),37.24357,67.22222,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Thursday, the 21st of August, they reached a great river called the Viadme, which is another of the rivers which flow from Paradise. It is a league in width, and flows through a very flat country, with great and wonderful force, and it is very muddy. It is lowest in winter, because the waters are frozen in the mountains, and the snow does not melt: but in the month of April it begins to increase, and goes on increasing continually for four months ; and this is because the summer melts the ice and snow.
 
 Last summer they said that it had swollen much more than usual; for it increased so much that the water reached a village, near the banks, and destroyed many houses, doing great damage.
 
 This river descends from the mountains, flows through the plains of the territory of Samarcand, and the land of Tartary, and falls into the sea of Bakou. It separates the government of Samarcard from that of Khorassan.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de. Narrative of the Embassy of Ruy Gonzalez De Clavijo to the Court of Timour, at Samarcand, A.d. 1403-6.

Termit,Termez,37.26106,67.30862,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On the Thursday that the ambassadors reached this great river, they crossed to the other side, and, in the afternoon, they arrived at a great city called Termit, which once belonged to India the Less, but is now in the territory of Samarcand, having been conquered by Timour Beg, and from this place the empire of Samarcand begins. The territory of this empire of Samarcand is called Mongolia, and the language of the people is Mongol, so that those on the other side of the river do not know it, as they speak Persian: and the handwriting which they use on the Samarcand side of the river, is not understood by those on the other side.
 
 The lord has certain scribes who read and write this Mongol writing. The land of Samarcand is very populous, and very rich and fertile.
 
 [Paragraph about customs.]
 
 This city of Termit, which the ambassadors had reached, was very large and populous, and it was without any wall.
 
 The city was surrounded by many gardens and streams of water. I cannot tell you more of this city, because we were very tired when we reached our lodging, except that we passed through populous streets and squares, where they sold many things. The ambassadors were received with much honour, and supplied with all that they required, and were presented with a silken robe. In this city a messenger arrived from the lord, who came to the ambassadors, and said that the lord saluted them, and desired to know how they had borne the journey, and how they had been treated, and whether they would soon arrive. When this messenger departed, they gave him a robe, and they also gave a Florentine robe to the knight who had been sent first, and who had come with them, the ambassador from the Sultan of Babylon doing the same. They also gave a horse to the second knight, whom the lord had sent; for such is the custom of all who come to the lord, to give something, and thus respect the custom of giving and taking presents. Their greatness is considered according to the number of presents they give, in honour of the lord, and such is the measure of the praise they receive.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

The surrounding country was flat, and they saw many villages, well watered pastures, and a very beautiful, bright, and well peopled country. In these plains there were many corn fields, vineyards, cotton plantations, melon grounds, and groves of fruit trees. The city was surrounded by a wall of earth, with a deep ditch, and drawbridges leading to the gates.
 
 The lord Timour Beg, and his father, were both natives of this city of Kesh.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

 This mosque, with its chapels, was very rich, and beautifully ornamented in blue and gold, and within it there was a large court, with trees, and ponds of water. In this mosque the lord gives twenty boiled sheep every day, for the souls of his father and son, who lie buried there.
 
 When the ambassadors arrived, they were conducted to this mosque, and provided with much meat and fruit;","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

 On Friday they were taken to see some great palaces, which the lord has ordered to be built, and they say that they have been working at them every day, for twenty years, and many workmen are still employed on them. These palaces had a long entrance, and a very high gateway. On each side there were arches of brick, covered with glazed tiles, and many patterns in various colours. These arches formed small recesses, without doors, and the ground was paved with glazed tiles. They are made for the attendants to sit in, when the lord is here.
 
 In front of the first entrance there was another gateway, leading to a great court yard paved with white stones, and surrounded by doorways of very rich workmanship. In the centre of the court there was a great pool of water, and this court was three hundred paces wide. The court led to the body of the building, by a very broad and lofty doorway, ornamented with gold and blue patterns on glazed tiles, richly and beautifully worked. On the top of this doorway there was the figure of a lion and a sun, [...]
 
 This doorway led to a reception room, the walls of which were covered with polished glazed tiles, in gold and blue patterns, and the ceiling was gilded all over. Thence the ambassadors were taken to so many chambers, that it would take a long time to describe them all, in which there were ornamental works in gold and blue, and many other colours, executed with wonderful skill. They were also shown the apartments which the lord has caused to be made for his women, which were covered with strange and rich ornaments, both on the walls, ceilings, and floors; and many skilled workmen were employed in this palace.
 
 Afterwards the ambassadors went to see a chamber, which the lord had set apart for feasting, and for the company of his women.
 
 In front of it there was a great garden, in which there were many shady trees, and all kinds of fruit trees, with channels of water flowing amongst them. The garden was so large, that great numbers of people might enjoy themselves there in summer with great delight, near the fountains, and under the shade of the trees. The workmanship of this palace was so rich that it would be impossible to describe it, without gazing and walking over everything, with slow steps. The mosque and palace are amongst the magnificent edifices which the lord has ordered to be built, in honour of his father, who lies interred there, and was a native of this city. But though he was a native of this city, he did not belong to the races of this land, but was of a lineage called Zagatay, which came from the land of Tartary when this country was conquered, as will presently be related to you.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Samarcand,Samarkand,39.62701,66.97497,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"On Monday, the 29th of September, the lord went to the city of Samarcand, and lodged in some houses near the entrance, which he had ordered to be built in honour of the mother of his wife Caño, who was interred in a chapel within these houses. These houses were very rich, and they were not yet finished, but every day there were men working at them. On this day the lord gave a great feast, and sent for the ambassadors. ...
 
 On this day the ambassadors were brought to the plain, and, when they arrived, they found many handsome tents pitched, most of them on the banks of the river, close together, and it was a very beautiful sight.
 
 The ambassadors went through some streets of tents, where they sold all that was required by this great host; and, when they were near the tents of the lord, they were placed under an awning, made of white linen cloth, ornamented with cloths of various colours, and it was long, and secured above by cords, to two poles, and there were many awnings of this kind on the plain, and they make them long and high, that the sun may be screened off, and that air may enter. 
 
 ...
 
 freely. Near these awnings, there was a great and lofty pavilion, which was like a tent, only square, and three lances high. It was a hundred paces broad, and had four corners, and the ceiling was round, like a vault. It was pitched against twelve poles, each as large round as a man, measured round the chest. They were painted gold and blue, and other colours, and from corner to corner there were poles, three fastened together, and making one. When they pitched the tents, they used wheels, like those of a cart, which were turned by men, and they have ropes fixed in various directions, to assist them. From the vault of the ceiling of the pavilion silken cloths descended, between each of the poles, which were fastened to them, and when they were fastened, they made an arch from one side to the other. Outside this square pavilion, there were porticoes, joined above to the pavilion, and supported by twenty-four poles, not so large as the central ones, so that the whole pavilion was supported by thirty-six poles. From this pavilion at least five hundred red cords were extended, and inside there was a crimson carpet, beautifully ornamented with silken cloths of many colours, and embroidered with gold threads. In the centre of the ceiling there was the richest work of all ; and in the four corners were the figures of four eagles, with their wings closed. The outside of the pavilion was lined with silk cloths, in black, white, and yellow stripes.
 
 At each corner there was a high pole, with a copper ball, and the figure of a crescent on the top; and in the centre, there was another tall pole, with a much larger copper ball and crescent; and, on the top of the pavilion, between these poles, there was a tower of silken cloths, with turrets, and an entrance door; and when the wind blew the pavilion about, or made the poles unsteady, men went on the top, and secured anything that was loose. This pavilion was so large and high that, from a distance, it looked like a castle ; and it was a very wonderful thing to see, and possessed more beauty than it is possible to describe.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Mosque in Samarcand,Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum,39.64854,66.96924,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"The lord loved this grandson very dearly, and had, therefore, ordered this mosque to be built in his honour. The lord went on that day to celebrate a vigil feast, and invited the ambassadors. When they came, they were shown the chapel and tomb. This chapel was square and very high, and was covered, both inside and out, with blue and gold ornaments.
 
 When this grandson died in Turkey, the lord sent the body to be interred in Samarcand, and ordered this mosque to be built. When the lord arrived, he said the chapel was too low, so he ordered it to be pulled down, and rebuilt in ten days. They worked day and night, and he himself came twice to the city, to watch the progress; and the chapel was finished in ten days. It is a wonder that so great a work could have been completed in so short a time.

Samarcand,Samarkand,39.62701,66.97497,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"In this city of Samarcand there is much merchandize, which comes every year from Cathay, India, Tartary, and many other parts; and as there is not a place for the orderly and regular display of the merchandize for sale, the lord ordered that a street should be made in the city, with shops for the sale of merchandize, This street was commenced at one end of the city, and went through to the other. He entrusted this work to two of his Meerzas, and let them know that if they did not use all diligence to complete it, working day and night, their heads should answer for it.
 
 These Meerzas began to work, by pulling down such houses as stood in the line by which the lord desired the street to run, and as the houses came down, their masters fled with their clothes and all they had : then, as the houses came down in front, the work went on behind. They made the street very broad, and covered it with a vaulted roof, having windows at intervals to let in the light.
 
 As soon as the shops were finished, people were made to occupy them, and sell their goods; and at intervals in this street there were fountains. A great number of workmen came into the city, and those who worked in the daytime, were relieved by others who worked all night. Some pulled down houses, others levelled the ground, and others built the street; and day and night they made such a noise, that they seemed to be like so many devils.
 
 This great work was finished in twenty days, which was very wonderful; and the owners of the houses which were pulled down went to certain Cayris,"" who were friends of the lord ; and one day, when they were playing at chess with the lord, they said that, as he had caused those houses to be destroyed, he ought to make some amends to the owners.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

Samarcand,Samarkand,39.62701,66.97497,Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,1404,"The city of Samarcand is situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall. It is a little larger than the city of Seville, but, outside the city, there are a great number of houses, joined together in many parts, so as to form suburbs.
 
 The city is surrounded on all sides by many gardens and vineyards, which extend in some directions a league and a half, in others two leagues, the city being in the middle. In these houses and gardens there is a large population, and there are people selling bread, meat, and many other things; so that the suburbs are much more thickly inhabited than the city within the walls. Amongst these gardens, which are outside the city, there are great and noble houses, and here the lord has several palaces. The nobles of the city have to year their houses amongst these gardens, and they are so extensive that, when a man approaches the city, he sees nothing but a mass of very high trees. Many streams of water flow through the city, and through these gardens, and among these gardens there are many cotton plantations, and melon grounds, and the melons of this land are good and plentiful ; and at Christmas time there is a wonderful quantity of melons and grapes. Every day so many camels come in, laden with melons, that it is a wonder how the people can eat them all.
 
 They preserve them from year in the villages, in the same way as figs, taking off their skins, cutting them in large slices, and then drying them in the sun.
 
 Outside the city there are great plains, which are covered with populous villages, peopled by the captives which the lord caused to be taken from the countries which he conquered. The land is very plentiful in all things, as well bread as wine, fruit, meat, and birds; and the sheep are very large, and have long tails, some weighing twenty pounds, and they are as much as a man can hold in his hand. These sheep are so abundant in the market that, even when the lord was there with all his host, a pair was worth only a ducat. Other things are so plentiful, that for a meri, which is half a rial, they sell a fanegal and a half of barley, and the quantity of bread and rice is infinite.
 
 The city is so large, and so abundantly supplied, that it is wonderful; and the name of Samarcand or Cimes-quinte is derived from the two words cimes great, and quinte a town. The supplies of this city do not consist of food alone, but of silks, satins, gauzes, tafetas, velvets, and other things. The lord had so strong a desire to ennoble this city, that he brought captives to increase its population, from every land which he conquered, especially all those who were skilful in From Damascus he brought weavers of silk, and men who made bows, glass, and earthenware, so that, of those articles, Samarcand produces the best in the world. From Turkey he brought archers, masons, and silversmiths. He also brought men skilled in making engines of war : and he sowed hemp and flax, which had never before been seen in the land.
 
 There was so great a number of people brought to this city, from all parts, both men and women, that they are said to have amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand persons, of many nations, Turks, Arabs, and Moors, Christian Armenians, Greek Catholics, and Jacobites, and those who baptize with fire in the face, who are Christians with peculiar opinions. There was such a multitude of these people that the city was not large enough to hold them, and it was wonderful what a number lived under trees, and in caves outside.
 
 The city is also very rich in merchandize which comes from other parts. Russia and Tartary send linen and skins ; China sends silks, which are the best in the world, (more especially the satins), and musk, which is found in no other part of the world, rubies and diamonds, pearls and rhubarb, and many other things. The merchandize which comes from China is the best and most precious which comes to this city, and they say that the people of China are the most skilful workmen in the world. They say themselves that they have two eyes, the Franks one, and that the Moors are blind, so that they have the advantage of every other nation in the world. From India come spices, such as nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, ginger, and many others which do not reach Alexandria.
 
 In the city there are many open places, in which they sellmeat cooked in many ways, fowls and other birds very nicely dressed ; and they are always selling, day and night, in these places. There are also many places for killing meat, fowls, pheasants, and partridges. At one end of the city there is a castle, which is defended on one side by a stream flowing through a deep ravine, and is very strong. The lord kept his treasure in that castle, and no man entered it except the magistrate and his officers. In this castle the lord had as many as a thousand captives, who were skilful workmen, and laboured all the year round at making head pieces, and bows and arrows.","Clavijo, Ruy Gonzalez de.

On the banks there were great plains of sand, and the sand was moved from one part to another, by the wind, and thrown up in mounds. In this sandy waste there are great valleys and hills, and the wind blew the sand away from one hill to another, for it was very light; and on the ground, where the wind had blown away the sand, the marks of waves and could not keep their eyes on this sand, when the sun was shining. This road cannot be travelled over, without a guide who knows the marks and signs of the desert, and these guides are called Anchies, and the ambassadors had one of these guides. On this road there is no water, except a few wells sunk in the sand, with vaulted roofs, and surrounded by brick walls, for if they were not covered, the sand would fill them up. The water of these wells is either rain or snow water; and in the last day's journey, they found no water, and they travelled all night; but at the hour of mass they came to a well, and drank, and gave water to their beasts, and they all had much need of it.

"Shark's Bay, New Holland","Shark Bay, Western Australia",-25.8132,113.3991,William Dampier,1699,"New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is not yet determined whether it is an island or a main continent; but I am certain that it joins neither to Asia, Africa, nor America. This part of it that we saw is all low even land, with sandy banks against the sea, only the points are rocky, and so are some of the islands in this bay. The land is of a dry sandy soil, destitute of water except you make wells; yet producing divers sorts of trees; but the woods are not thick, nor the trees very big. Most of the trees that we saw are dragon-trees as we supposed; and these too are the largest trees of any there. They are about the bigness of our large apple-trees, and about the same height; and the rind is blackish and somewhat rough. The leaves are of a dark colour; the gum distils out of the knots or cracks that are in the bodies of the trees. We compared it with some gum-dragon or dragon's blood that was aboard, and it was of the same colour and taste. The other sort of trees were not known by any of us. There was pretty long grass growing under the trees; but it was very thin. We saw no trees that bore fruit or berries. We saw no sort of animal nor any track of beast but once; and that seemed to be the tread of a beast as big as a great mastiff-dog. Here are a few small land-birds but none bigger than a blackbird; and but few sea-fowls. Neither is the sea very plentifully stored with fish unless you reckon the manatee and turtle as such.

Lake Torrens,Lake Torrens South Australia,-31.4796,137.5134,Edward John Eyre,1840,"I found Lake Torrens completely girded by a steep sandy ridge, exactly like the sandy ridges bounding the sea shore, no rocks or stones were visible any where, but many saline coasts peeped out in the outer ridge, and upon descending westerly to its basin, I found the dry bed of the lake coated completely over with a crust of salt, forming one unbroken sheet of pure white, and glittering brilliantly in the sun. On stepping upon this I found that it yielded to the foot, and that below the surface the bed of the lake consisted of a soft mud, and the further we advanced to the westward the more boggy it got, so that at last it became quite impossible to proceed, and I was obliged to return to the outer margin of the lake without ascertaining whether there was water on the surface of its bed further west or not. The extraordinary deception caused by mirage and refraction, arising from the state of the atmosphere in these regions, makes it almost impossible to believe the evidence of one's own eyesight; but as far as I could judge under these circumstances, it appeared to me that there was water in the bed of the lake at a distance of four or five miles from where I was, and at this point Lake Torrens was about fifteen or twenty miles across, having high land bounding it to the west, seemingly a continuation of the table land at the head of Spencer's gulf on its western side. Foiled in the hope of reaching the water, I stood gazing on the dismal prospect before me with feelings of chagrin and gloom. I can hardly say I felt disappointed, for my expectations in this quarter had never been sanguine; but I could not view unmoved, a scene which from its character and extent, I well knew must exercise a great influence over my future plans and hopes: the vast area of the lake was before me interminable as far as the eye could see to the northward, and the country upon its shore, was desolate and forbidding. It was evident, that I could never hope to take my party across the lake, and it was equally evident, that I should not be able to travel around its shores, from the total absence of all fresh water, grass, or wood, whilst the very saline nature of the soil in the surrounding country, made even the rain water salt, after lying for an hour or two upon the ground. My only chance of success now lay in the non-termination of Flinders range, and in the prospect it held out to me, that by continuing our course along it we might be able to procure grass and water in its recesses, until we were either taken beyond Lake Torrens, or led to some practicable opening to the north.","Edward John Eyre, Journals of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia and Overland from Adelaide to King George's Sound in the Years 1840-1 (London: T. and W.

For seven miles the country continued gently to ascend, the sandstone giving place to trap boulders, yielding a very rich soil, clothed with short green grass and melons, the soil being too stony for agricultural purposes, although I have seen country of a similar appearance in the island of Mauritius producing fine crops of sugar. Some of the melons weighed as much as five or six ounces, and were passably good eating, although rather bitter. At noon the country dropped suddenly to the northward, and we descended a deep rocky ravine, in which we soon found water and grass. Travelling now became difficult and sometimes dangerous to the horses; rugged and semi-columnar metamorphic sandstone cliffs hemmed in the ravines on either side, while large rounded boulders of trap-rock filled the bed of the stream, which in several places was running.

At this point the hills recede from the river, and open downs and lightly-timbered plains take their place on the left bank, while the ranges of the right bank are still close to the river. To the west of our course, and about 12 miles off, we observe a tier of blue ranges I have called the Carr-Boyd Ranges, after my second in command.","W.J.

New York City,"New York City, New York",40.7065,-74.0126,John M. Duncan,1818,"I have now spent several weeks in New York, but shall postpone for the present any remarks upon the social, moral, or political characteristics of its inhabitants, in the hope that I shall hereafter have abundant opportunities of more extensive observation; the remaining pages of this letter shall rather be devoted to brief notices of the more remarkable peculiarities of their city. New York is built upon the southern point of Manhattan island, and enjoys a situation in every respect admirably suited for commercial purposes. The Hudson, or North River, passes it upon the one side; a narrow part of Long Island Sound, familiarly termed the East River, washes it upon the other; while in front is a noble bay, expanding between the shores of Long Island and New Jersey, in which the united navies of the world might spread their canvass. Below the bay are the Narrows, facilitating the defence of the harbour, and at various points above and below them are forts of such imposing strength, that it seems impossible that any naval armament can ever reach the city, unless in consequence of the co-operating exertions of a powerful land force. Ice very rarely, now, obstructs the navigation, and about twenty miles from the city the Atlantic opens to the vessels, without a rock or island thereafter to annoy them. With the eastern coast of
  America, there is a convenient and safe communication through Long Island Sound; and the Hudson, having its source in the upper part of the state, affords an inland navigation, even for large vessels, of more than a hundred and fifty miles. The harbour of New York is one of the best in the country, and is capable of almostunlimited extension. The wharfs skirt both sides of the island, and piers project at rightangles into the stream, leaving intermediate slips, which have many of the advantagesof wet docks and are free from several of their inconveniences. The tides rise and fallabout six feet, but there is always water enough abreast of the piers to float the largestmerchantmen. They do not however enjoy the advantage of dry docks, for the tide doesnot ebb sufficiently to empty them and mechanical means have not yet been resorted to;but vessels which need repair are hove down in shallow water, first upon the one side and then upon the other.","John M.

Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",42.3621,-71.0514,John M. Duncan,1818,"Boston occupies a small peninsula in Massachusetts bay, and possesses a safe and commodious harbour, strongly defended from maritime attacks. The commerce of Boston is very considerable; probably in this respect it ranks as the fourth city in the United States,
  for New York, Philadelphia, and I believe New Orleans, are before it. The town has outgrown the limits of the position which it occupies, and Charlestown upon an opposite peninsula, and South Boston upon the main land, may be regarded as integral parts of the city. Circumscribed, however, as they are, the citizens have had the good taste to reserve a park of upwards of forty acres, upon which no buildings have been allowed to encroach. The Mall, as this is called, is surrounded with spreading elms, and is the finest that is to be found within the limits of any considerable town in the United States. It would be needless to remark how much it contributes to the beauty of the town, and the comfort of the inhabitants, were it not that so simple and so obvious an ornament is strangely overlooked in the larger American cities, notwithstanding the abundance of elbow room which all of them enjoy. Boston has much more of the appearance of a British town than New York. Many of the buildings are of a fine white granite, and most of the others are of brick; the streets are very compactly built, and although many are narrow and crooked, all exhibit a degree of order and cleanliness which will in vain be looked for in New York. On a finely rising ground at the upper part of the Mall, stands the State House, a building of humbler
  pretensions as to size and materials than the New York City Hall, but in situation and architectural outline greatly superior. It is nearly square; in front is a lofty projecting colonnade of the Corinthian order, twelve columns in length, springing from a piazza of rusticated arches, but unhappily bearing only a balustrade, over which rises a small attic story with a pediment; and overtopping all is a large circular dome terminated by a small square lantern. From the lantern of the State House a most commanding view is obtained
  of the surrounding country. In front is Boston bay, studded with nearly forty islands, with fortifications and a light house; the shores which surround its ample basin, advancing and receding with most capricious irregularity, and forming numerous capes and peninsulas,
  on one of the largest of which is the city. The vast amphitheatre around the bay exhibits a country richly variegated with hill and valley, immense forests and cultivated ground; and sprinkled with about twenty little towns of snowy whiteness, among which a dozen of
  spires may be counted.","John M. Duncan, Travels Through Part of the United States and Canada in 1818 and 1819 (London: Hurst, Robinson, & Company, 1823), 37-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6788a/6788a.pdf,United States of America,Eastern Coast,North America
Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",39.9418,-75.1674,John M. Duncan,1818,"The position of Philadelphia, although not equal to that of New York, is yet well chosen in reference to the character of the surrounding country. The city stands upon an isthmus about two miles wide, between the Delaware and the Schuylkill, five miles above their confluence, and about an hundred and twenty miles from the sea. Both rivers are navigable up to the city by the largest merchantmen. The Delaware is here about a mile in width; the tide rises and falls about six feet, and vessels of 1200 tons can come up to the wharfs. In severe winters, the communication with the sea is still occasionally interrupted; but not so frequently as formerly, nor for so long at one time, and as the surrounding country becomes cleared of its forests the severity of the winters will be still
  farther mitigated. The course of the two rivers at the city is very nearly north and south, but almost immediately above, they diverge; the Delaware to the northeast, and the Schuylkill to the north-west, thus materially facilitating the commercial communication with the interior of the State, and the adjoining one of New Jersey. The Delaware is navigable by large sloops and steam boats to Trenton, about thirty miles above, and the Schuylkill, although above the city comparatively shallow and disturbed with rapids, is navigable by small vessels and rafts to a considerable distance. A little deepening of this river in some places, and the cutting of short canals from one stream to another, would open a communication for some hundreds of miles into the interior. The ground on which the city stands, is covered with a stratum of fine clay; the banks of the Schuylkill furnish a plentiful supply of marble, and the country around is rich in timber, so that materials for building are most abundant. The appearance of the city from the river is by no means imposing; rather the opposite. The ground is generally level, and the mass of buildings present a dull heavy uniformity; most of those along the bank are by no means elegant, and only a solitary steeple rises above the dense horizon. The aspect however improves amazingly when you enter the streets, which are wide, straight, and clean, and, with only one exception, cross each other at right angles. The houses are in general of painted brick, but some of the more modern have a flight of marble steps in front, and the lintels of the doors and windows, and even the side walk in front, are of the same beautiful materials.","John M. Duncan, Travels Through Part of the United States and Canada in 1818 and 1819 (London: Hurst, Robinson, & Company, 1823), 128-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6788a/6788a.pdf,United States of America,Eastern Coast,North America
Baltimore,"Baltimore, Maryland",39.2687,-76.5998,John M. Duncan,1818,"Baltimore is built at the top of a small bay in the river Patapsco, near its entrance into the Chesapeake, and consists of two portions, nearly a mile asunder; the upper of which is properly speaking the town, and the lower called Fell's Point is the harbour. The water comes up to the town but it is shallow and in general none but coasters go past the Point. The bay is formed and protected by a peninsular tongue of land which stretches downwards into the river; the entrance is narrow and is completely commanded by a fort,
  which sustained a heavy bombardment during last war. The town is built with considerable regularity, upon portions of three hills and their intervening 220 valleys; many of the streets cross each other at right angles, and they are in general spacious and well paved. A large proportion of the buildings are of brick; the more ancient, in consequence of inattention to painting, have rather a gloomy aspect, but the modern ones resemble in every respect those of New York and Philadelphia. In public buildings Baltimore aspires to distinction, but some of the most considerable are as yet only in progress. A massy brick edifice which is intended for an Exchange has been roofed in; externally it is remarkable for dimensions rather than elegance, and of its internal appearance I can say nothing. Two new churches are going forward, the one destined to be a Romish Cathedral the other a Socinian Chapel. They stand very near each other, rather above the city, and as yet a considerable space is open around them.
  The style of the respective buildings strikes me as somewhat appropriate to the system which it has been erected to support.","John M. Duncan, Travels Through Part of the United States and Canada in 1818 and 1819 (London: Hurst, Robinson, & Company, 1823), 150.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6788a/6788a.pdf,United States of America,Eastern Coast,North America
"Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C.",38.8897,-77.0333,John M. Duncan,1818,"I Have now the honour of addressing you from the metropolis of the United States. It is common here to call Washington ‘the city in the woods,’ I was therefore somewhat surprised to find that there is little or no wood near it. The aspect of the city indeed would have been much improved by a few trees, to fill up the vacancies, and thus afford something for the eye to rest upon between one group of buildings and another. The soil however is poor, and the probability is that there has never been much timber on this spot;
  I have noticed none of the stumps which are usually left when the forests are felled. The position which was selected for the Federal city, is a point of land embraced by the forking of the river Potowmak, about one hundred and twenty miles from its junction with the Chesapeake, and about two hundred and fifty miles from the sea. The principal branch of the river flows down upon the west, and unites with the smaller one from the eastward in front of the city. Ships of war of the largest size can float in safety three or four
  miles above the junction of the streams. It was expected that this situation would have been found particularly favourable to commercial enterprize, and consequently that the population would rapidly increase; hitherto however these hopes have not been realized.
  Georgetown, about a mile above upon the principal branch of the river, monopolizes the inland trade, and Alexandria seven miles below intercepts the foreign; while the barrenness of the surrounding country is discouraging to settlers. The prosperity of Washington therefore seems to be in a great measure dependent on its advantages as the seat of government, and these in a new government, economical even to penuriousness in the salaries of its public officers, cannot as yet be very important....The original plan of the city was on a most extensive scale. A parallelogram more than four miles and a half long, and two miles broad, was regularly divided into streets, avenues, and squares, and should the anticipations of its founders be realized, this will after all be but the nucleus of the future metropolis. The streets are laid out towards the cardinal points, crossing each other at right angles; the avenues intersect these diagonally, so as to avoid the tiresome sameness which is observable in Philadelphia, and extensive squares are to be placed at the crossings of these transverse lines. The avenues are from 130 to 160 feet wide, the streets from 80 to 110.","John M. Duncan, Travels Through Part of the United States and Canada in 1818 and 1819 (London: Hurst, Robinson, & Company, 1823), 168-70.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6788a/6788a.pdf,United States of America,Eastern Coast,North America
Albany,"Albany, New York",42.6529,-73.7475,John M. Duncan,1818,"Albany was, an early Dutch settlement and the streets are filled with Dutch names, of most difficult and cacophonous utterance. The town consisted originally of a single street, skirting the bank of the river, which takes a slight bend here; but it subsequently extended backwards very considerably, and some of the recent streets towards the north are spacious and well built, and as usual lined with poplars. In many places there is a singular mixture of poverty and splendour. A number of the old Dutch erections are still standing; small houses of red and yellow bricks, with the gable end to the street, having a door and window in the ground floor, a single window in the next, and above it the year of their erection embossed upon the surface in huge iron figures, and the whole surmounted with an iron weather-cock rusted upon the rod. There is an air of antiquity about these buildings, which is interesting in a country where antiquity is so rare. The modern erections exhibit the same tasteful style which prevails in New York and Philadelphia. Two or three of the public buildings are of white marble; one of them is surmounted with a very neat dome, but in another the effect of the marble wall is sadly disfigured by the untasteful addition of a red tiled roof. The Capitol, or State House has rather a neat portico, and a dome surmounted with a statue of Justice; it stands at the upper end of a very steep but wide street, running at right angles to the river. Near the Capitol is a very neat Academy with two wings, built of reddish coloured freestone.","John M.

Toronto,"Toronto, Canada",43.651,-79.3746,Henry C. Todd,1833,"On Jan. 27, 1833, I arrived in York—now changed to Toronto, its aborigine name—the capital of Upper Canada. A very few years since the wilderness, a swamp and unknown; the whole country, up to 1784, being one vast forest: it now contains over 10,000 inhabitants. A cedar swamp produces good water, and is of itself healthy; which is likewise the case where hemlock, spruce and fir abound. General Simcoe, the first governor of the province, chose Toronto, which he called, little York, in 1794, as the best scite [sic] for a capital, though he contemplated London, in the London District, from its central position between the large lakes, and its favorable situation on the river Thames. Toronto is a mass of shops, the leading feature of Canadian and American towns, 75 insomuch
  that you can hardly sneeze without bespattering a store. Its winters are six weeks shorter than those of Quebec. The original settlers of Upper Canada, (discovered by John Cabot, in 1497, whose family resided in England) were American refugees, and part of the 82nd
  regiment, disbanded on termination of the revolutionary war. Each private receiving 200 acres, without restrictions, but on discovering they would sell them for a bottle of brandy, the grant was reduced to 100, with settlement duties, and a residence of three years before enabled to sell. They located on the Long Sault, and at Niagara, formerly Newark. The first vessel which entered the Bay of Toronto, was a brig commanded by capt. Richardson, whose son is an elder in the Episcopal Methodist Society of this city. Twenty–seven steamboats ply on Lake Ontario, Bay of Quinte, and river St. Lawrence: I have counted seven at a time in Toronto Bay. Cranberry marshes in the township of Wedderburn, on account of their fever–breeding properties, are called the Infernal place: a Mr. J. Cummer, farmer and miller of Yonge Street, was the first person born in the township of Toronto: in 1834 he was thirty–five years of age. The episcopal–church is a well–built stone structure, has a choir and organ, and will contain 3000 persons. There are two catholic chapels in the city, three methodist, and four other places of public worship. The establishment of Upper Canada consists of the bishop of Quebec, two archdeacons, and circa sixty clergymen","Henry C.

Ottawa,"Ottawa, Ontario",45.4183,-75.7009,Katherine E. Bates,1887,"Another shake of the Canadian kaleidoscope lands me at Ottawa. Here, I think, we first realized the strange incongruities of Canada; the mixture of advanced civilization with provincial incompleteness, as shown by these rough unfinished Canadian roads lighted up by brilliant electric light. Streets here are reckoned by miles; but they dwindle away into what we should consider merely “tracks,” and even in the cities themselves this curious anomaly is ever present: a handsome brick or stone house, and, next door to it, a wooden
  hovel; electric light, lighting up roads covered with “rocks” or impassable from mud or pools of water. But we toiled up above all these queer contrasts and the ugly provincial rectangular town, to Barrack Hill and the beautiful Government buildings of pink and cream sandstone; and a lovely autumn picture remains in my memory: on one side of the buildings a deep ravine, clothed with trees arrayed in all their autumn bravery; on the other a far-away stretch of wood and river, the Chaudière Falls as a background, and the famous lumber yards, looking quite picturesque, thanks to the enchantment of distance and the last lingering touch of a quickly sinking sun. The bright, crisp air turns suddenly grey and chill, and we hasten home to make final preparations for our start to Toronto
  and a first night in the famous Pullman cars.","Katherine E. Bates, A Year in the Great Republic (London: Ward & Downey, 1887), 21.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/1394a/1394a.pdf,Canada,Eastern Coast,North America
"Hudson River Valley, Catskill Mountains",New York State,42.1813,-73.8607,Isabella L. Bird,1854,"The sun of a November morning had just risen as I left Albany, and in a short time beamed upon swelling hills, green savannahs, and waving woods fringing the margin of the Hudson. At Coxsackie the river expands into a small lake, and the majestic Catsgill Mountains rise abruptly from the western side. The scenery among these mountains is very grand and varied. Its silence and rugged sublimity recall the Old World: it has rocky pinnacles and desert passes, inaccessible eminences and yawning chasms. The world might grow populous at the feet of the Catsgills, but it would leave them untouched and unprofaned in their stern majesty. From this point for a hundred miles the eyes of the traveller are perfectly steeped in beauty, which, gathering and increasing, culminates at West Point, a lofty eminence jutting upon a lake apparently without any outlet. The spurs of mountain ranges which meet here project in precipices from five to fifteen hundred feet in height; trees find a place for their roots in every rift among the rocks; festoons of clematis and wild-vine hang in graceful drapery from base to summit, and the dark mountain shadows loom over the lake-like expanse below. The hand wearies of writing of the loveliness of this river. I saw it on a perfect day. The Indian summer lingered, as though unwilling that the chilly blasts of winter should blight the loveliness of this beauteous scene. The gloom of autumn was not there, but its glories were on every leaf and twig. The bright scarlet of the maple vied with the brilliant berries of the rowan, and from among the tendrils of the creepers, which were waving in the sighs of the west wind, peeped forth the deep crimson of the sumach. There were very few signs of cultivation; the banks of the Hudson are barren in all but beauty. The river is a succession of small wild lakes, connected by narrow reaches, bound for ever between abrupt precipices. There are lakes more beauteous than Loch Katrine, softer in their features than Loch Achray, though like both, or like the waters which glitter beneath the blue sky of Italy. Along their margins the woods hung in scarlet and gold— high above towered the purple peaks—the blue waters flashed back the rays of a sun shining from an unclouded sky—the air was warm like June—and I think the sunbeams of that day scarcely shone upon a fairer scene. At mid-day the Highlands of Hudson were left behind—the mountains melted into hills—the river expanded into a noble stream about a mile in width—the scarlet woods, the silvery lakes, and the majestic Catsgills faded away in the distance; and with a whoop, and a roar, and a clatter, the cars entered into, and proceeded at slackened speed down, a long street called Tenth Avenue, among carts, children, and pigs.","Isabella L.

Montreal,"Montreal, Quebec",45.5161,-73.6148,Isabella L. Bird,1854,"The exploit is one of the most agreeable which the traveller can perform, and the thick morning mist added to the apparent danger. We steamed for four or five miles farther down the river, when suddenly the great curtain of mist was rolled up as by an invisible hand, and the scene which it revealed was Montreal. I never saw a city which looked so magnificent from the water. It covers a very large extent of ground, which gently slopes upwards from the lake-like river, and is backed by the Mountain, a precipitous hill, 700 feet in height. It is decidedly foreign in appearance, even from a distance. When the fog cleared away it revealed this mountain, with the forest which covers it, all scarlet and purple; the blue waters of the river hurried joyously along; the Green and Belleisle mountains wore the rosy tints of dawn; the distances were bathed in a purple glow; and the tin roofs, lofty spires, and cupolas of Montreal flashed back the beams of the rising sun. A lofty Gothic edifice, something from a distance like Westminster Abbey, and handsome public buildings, with a superb wharf a mile long, of hewn stone, present a very imposing appearance from the water. We landed from the first lock of a ship-canal, and I immediately drove to the residence of the Bishop of Montreal, a house near the mountain, in a very elevated situation, and commanding a magnificent view. From the Bishop and his family I received the greatest kindness, and have very agreeable recollections of Montreal....Montreal is an extraordinary place. It is alive with business and enterprising traders, with soldiers, carters, and equipages. Through the kindness of the Bishop, I saw everything of any interest in the town. The first thing which attracted my attention was the magnificent view from the windows of the See-house, over the wide St. Lawrence and the green mountains of Vermont; the next, an immense pair of elaborately-worked bronze gates, at a villa opposite, large enough for a royal residence. The side-walks in the outskirts of the town were still of the villanous wood, but in the streets they were very substantial, and, like the massive stone houses, look as if they had lasted for two hundred years, and might last for a thousand more","Isabella L.

It is true we know not what awaits us in other portions of this Golden State, but we are constantly meeting people who having tried a residence in all other localities, return delightedly to this beautiful San Gabriel Valley. Along its northern borders stretches the Sierra Madre range of mountains, a barrier that effectually protects the city nestling at its feet from every rude, cold blast, and adds to it yet another blessing, that of pure water, the principal supply coming from Devil's Gate, though one would naturally look for fire from this source rather than cooling springs. The charm also of grandeur and sublimity, Pasadena by this proximity, does not lack. With David, we “lift our eyes unto the hills,” for we cannot help it. They entice us, they appall us, they command our reverence, they invite our ever changing admiration by their shifting phases. Severe in outline, seamed with gorges, and chasms, producing thus a strange wrinkled effect as if some Titan hand held aloft a vast drapery that thence fell naturally in seam, and crease, and fold; almost barren of vegetation, seemingly unwooded, though we are assured that impenetrable forests exist in some of their wildest depths, but in compensation for this softening charm of New England hills, the loftier Sierras veil themselves in shadowy mists and vapors, they play hide seek with fleecy clouds, that drift across their breasts and lurk in their deep valleys, while still rearing aloft their hoary heads into the clear blue ether which envelopes them with a light that was never seen before on sea or land, while grander than all, old “Baldy” smiles down on the fertile valley from his realm of snow. Cruel mothers (madres), these jagged peaks have proved to many venturesome climbers, nearly a dozen people having perished here in the last three years, in sight of home, being lured into some chasm, or death-trap, from which there was no escape.","Susie C.

She numbers to-day 80,000 inhabitants, and her miles of broad level avenues are filled with fine buildings and noble residences that might serve as architectural models, including a City Hall and Post Office of which she may well be proud; they abound with granite blocks, hotels and stores stocked as choicely as the emporiums of our Eastern merchants, indeed we have seldom visited a more enterprising, stirring, energetic, and wide-awake city. It seems destined to become the second metropolis of this extensive coast, and being situated 500 miles nearer the tropics than San Francisco, in a climate and amid natural surroundings that are faultless, it must remain a favorite place of residence.

Santa Barbara,"Santa Barbara, California",34.4203,-119.6891,Susie C. Clark,1889,"From earliest childhood the praises of Santa Barbara, more than of any other spot in California have been chanted in our ears; it has been pictured as the most favored haunt of Flora and Pomona, the chosen resort of poet and artist who find in its golden, dolce far niente atmosphere that inspiration sought in vain in harsher climes. It has offered health to the invalid, peace to the restless and broken in spirit, wealth to the investor, a perpetual delight to the visiting traveller, such as no other locality can, because forsooth, there is but one Santa Barbara in the world. Extravagant anticipations are rarely realized. Perhaps we had expected too much, or it was unfortunate that we did not visit this spot prior to our acquaintance with Pasadena, the contrast to that city's immaculate neatness and lavish cultivation being here so marked. Yet charms Santa Barbara undoubtedly possesses of a very high order. Its climate is perhaps without a parallel. Unlike many other southern resorts which omit winter from their calendar, it omits summer also, so that there is almost no change of seasons. Its placid resident does not spend six months of every year in preparing for the remaining semester, as in less favored New England. He knows neither torrid days nor frigid nights; the wear and tear of life is reduced to a minimum, likewise it would seem its zest and highest achievement. Mercury seldom ranges higher than our average summer days, and never drops to the freezing point. The most tender flowers bloom perpetually, unless forced to rest by being deprived of irrigation. Fruits of all kinds are always ripe. Strawberry short-cake was served in the waning days of November, also green peas, and tomatoes from a plant seven years old, that had borne continually. Oh yes, a climate that can lead the world we cheerfully concede to Santa Barbara. It is also “beautiful for situation,” covering the pleasant slope from the base of the Santa Ynez mountains, which form its picturesque background, down to the lovely Bay, not unlike the Bay of Naples in contour, whose misty horizon line is broken twenty miles away by three verdant islands, one of them being used as a ranch by the largest sheep owners in the world. There is also here a pretty curving beach, too rocky however for comfortable bathing, with a swiftly-running surf that one can stand to his heart's content to enjoy, but there is no opportunity to sit and list to the wild wave's roar, for a brief moment.","Susie C.

Riverside,"Riverside, California",33.9544,-117.3814,Susie C. Clark,1889,"Pasadena has a twin, and her name is Riverside. They are both “in verdure clad” right royally, and possess many attributes in common, resembling each other more closely perhaps in age, in rapid growth, and many minor characteristics than any other two cities of California. Pasadena is much the larger place; and while conceding to it a superior situation, a beauty of adornment, and a home-like charm found nowhere else, we must grant to Riverside the palm of fruit-culture. The acme of orange-fruitage is certainly attained here, both in extent and in quality. The orchards are indeed “groves,” the trees being so large and full as to completely overshadow and hide the residences, which we know exist somewhere in their green depths. Riverside is situated in San Bernardino County, seven miles from Colton. This county, by the way, is the largest in the United States. Within its borders fifteen States the size of “little Rhody” could be placed without crowding. The Santa Ana river runs through the neighborhood, hence the name—Riverside—chosen for the settlement in 1871, when the gigantic scheme for irrigation was begun. The soil of Riverside is a red clay mixed with sand—washed probably from the mountain,—a most unpromising, sterile-looking soil, but needing evidently only a little scratching and a plentiful supply of water to prove itself especially adapted to fruits of all kinds. Energetic labor was not lacking in the early settlers of this happily chosen locality, and their canal system of irrigation challenges the admiration of every visitor. The river above the town was tapped, and two cemented canals constructed, twelve and fourteen miles long, ten to twenty feet wide, from which sub-canals (100 miles of them) surround every block, with gateways through which the water can be admitted to the grounds from the main artery, at pleasure....The show-card of Riverside is of course Magnolia Avenue, the finest drive it is claimed in the world. To reach it, however, a drive of three miles from our pleasant quarters at the Glenwood is necessary. Back of Riverside as at Pasadena is an arroyo, or valley, 40 feet deep and a quarter of a mile wide. Crossing this, we, reach a portion of the town known as Brockton square, because its residents are all natives of that thriving city of Mass. Next comes a strip of Government land, a mile wide, and then the tract named by some New York investors, Arlington, through which the beautiful avenue runs. Its width of 132 feet is divided into a double drive by a magnificent continuous row of pepper-trees through its centre. On either side, and between the drives and the 20 feet wide promenades, is a varied growth of trees and palms, evergreens, the eucalyptus, which unless trimmed grows 8 to 15 feet in height every year, the beautiful gravilia, and at the four corners of each intersecting avenue, a magnolia tree. Extend this vista, flecked with its enchanting lights and shades, its sunbeams crossed by waving branches, for ten miles. Imagine on its outer borders a thick green hedge which encloses residences that here find frontage, or orange groves that are simply endless in every direction, their glossy green boughs weighed down with their wealth of ripened fruit, and one can readily believe it all seems too lovely to be true, like an illusion of some magician's wand.","Susie C.

San Diego,"San Diego, California",32.7838,-117.2052,Susie C. Clark,1889,"The modern city of San Diego is regularly laid out with broad avenues, suitably numbered and lettered, and very level, excepting on its northern boundary where Florence Hill rises somewhat abruptly, crowned with fine residences. Its stores have an Eastern look, and the prices of goods are very reasonable. Its people are pleasant and affable, and many are of New England birth. The chief natural charm of San Diego is undoubtably its equable climate, its uniform spring-like temperature, in summer or in winter; added to this, there is a buoyancy, a remarkable uplifting quality in the atmosphere. One does not feel that he weighs an ounce in San Diego, although the scales show a steady upward-going endency. There are sea-turns and breezes occasionally, but these are tempered by the peninsula which lies between the Bay and the Ocean—fair Coronado. And one attempts the description of this exceptionable seaside-resort most reluctantly, for it must be seen and felt to be thoroughly appreciated. With a temperature that allows fruits of tropical and temperate zones to ripen side by side, with a bay and an ocean on either hand, its beach one of the finest in the world, its surf magnificent, and with a radiant sunlit atmosphere that no pen can ever portray, or brush transmit, what wonder that this location was chosen for that Aladdin's palace—the Hotel del Coronado, the largest on the globe. It is a unique structure, with an architectural style of its own, stretching itself easily and gracefully over seven acres of ground, enclosing thus a courtyard where rare flowers bloom beneath the dashing spray of fountains, and palms shade the walks that lead thither from the drawing and music rooms, from rotunda and many private diningrooms that border this garden. When at evening electric lights shed their glamour o'er the scene, touching the verdure with such livid brilliancy, when choice music adds its charm to the soft air, when fair forms picturesquely clad, float in and out from light to shadow, we realize that childhood's dreams of fairy-land were all true and are now realized. Rumors reached our celibate ears of wonderful bridal suites in unvisited regions of this vast place that are dreams of Oriental splendor, but we gained or coveted no nearer acquaintance with their white and golden elegance. Besides this hotel, a thriving little town has sprung up on the peninsula in the last three years, with an ostrich farm, and pleasant little parks. Communication with the main land is by ferry-boat. Many delightful trips can be enjoyed from San Diego, one to Lakeside, a mountainous district in the Cajone canon, another to Ensenada, Mexico, by steamer, or, the Mexican border can also be reached by a twenty-mile ride in an open motor-car along the Bay to National City (a stirring place which still shows many evidences of a mushroom growth), through its suburbs, where olives are extensively cultivated, and from which diverges the road to Sweetwater Dam, the city's reservoir, thence across a desolate country given over to cacti of various kinds and grease-wood bushes, whose oily roots are sought for fuel, to Tia Juana where one can visit the Government building and be officially stamped, or drive to the monument marking the boundary line between California and Mexico.","Susie C.

San Francisco,"San Francisco, California",37.7701,-122.4424,Susie C. Clark,1889,"So magnificent a harbor as San Francisco Bay, one in which the combined navies of the world might easily find commodious anchorage, demanded as a natural sequence that a populous and cosmopolitan city should be built upon its shores. The fact that the site chosen for the city was a succession of hills and ridges proved no insurmountable obstacle. We had heard that San Francisco was built upon one hundred hills. We have not counted them, but do not believe the number overestimated. And such hills! The usual comparison “steep as the roof of a house” does only partial justice to their acute incline. Nothing could climb some of them it would seem but a cat or a squirrel and yet up their successive and thickly settled terraces mount steadily and speedily the cable cars with which the city is completely honeycombed in every direction, naught but the tops of their roofs being visible to the observer at the foot of the hill. And, reaching the summit, the cars pitch almost perpendicularly downward as a fly descends the walls of a room, or as a ship dips into the trough of a heavy sea, only to mount a higher and steeper hill beyond, continuing this see-sawing, style of locomotion for miles all over the city. Exaggeration here is an impossibility, for it is all so utterly incredible, even while we gaze.","Susie C.

Oakland,"Oakland, California",37.8064,-122.2701,Susie C. Clark,1889,"Six miles from San Francisco, as the sea-gull flies, across the pleasant waters of the bay, stands the beautiful city of Oakland, with Alameda and Berkeley on either side. Oakland has been called the city of residences (or in slang parlance, Frisco's bedroom), and it wears the title appropriately. It has a diurnal population of about 65,000, and while possessing a thriving little business centre of its own, its wide level streets are chiefly occupied by beautiful villas and homes. The gardens which surround them remind us at this winter season of Pasadena taking a nap, and an opossum kind of nap too, a partial rest with one eye open, for Nature never sleeps in this wondrous land. Everywhere rose bushes are bristling with buds that await only a few more (lays of sunshine to expand, magnolias promise even earlier unfoldment, and the callas are already in their prime; indeed Oakland seems pre-eminently their chosen home, for every yard displays its abundant share of these snowy, mammoth 82 flowers. And we note here such variety of trees from the native live-oak, (whose abundance christened the city), the locust and cottonwood, to the ornate, feathery-leaved acacia, in its many subdivisions, the mustard, fig, cypress, and numberless varieties of palms. We counted fifteen new specimens of trees and shrubs which we had never seen before, in one short walk, and were obliged to remain in ignorance as to their proper classification, for the resident, to the manor born, never knows, and doesn't even know that he does not know...The social atmosphere of Oakland is genial, quiet, restful and receptive to the advanced thought of the day. For this and many other reasons the traveller is induced to cast anchor in this calm haven and taste the rare pleasure of a long sojourn in this lovely place, indeed a life-sentence could be delightfully served out, here. The climate, while not so mild in winter as southern resorts, knows no sultry weather in mid-summer. Its sky is often blue and serene when a small hurricane is blowing through the streets of the larger city across the bay. There is a beautiful lake in the eastern part of Oakland surrounded by handsome villas, and in every direction there are the most enticing walks and drives, one of especial charm leading out to Piedmont, situated as its name implies, on the foot-hills of the Contra Costa range. A more magnificent view than the one obtained from this height can hardly be imagined. Oakland lies at our feet like a crescent moon; just beyond, Alameda stretches her long arm into the blue bay; on the further shore of this broad expanse of waters, San Francisco sits on her many hills, while others still higher,rise behind her. From our vantage ground we can look straight through the Golden Gate, in whose royal portals the white masts of coming and departing vessels are tipped with flame in the light of the setting sun, which makes a long lane of glory between the green islands of this inland sea. What peace rests upon it! What diverse craft here find anchorage! At present there are Her Britannic Majesty's flag-ship Swiftshire, our own Charleston, in virgin white from stem to stern, a French man-of-war, and the Chinese mail steamer, together with sloops, whalers, ferry-boats and tugs innumerable, plying busily in every direction.","Susie C.

It is a quiet sea-coast town, with pretty residences and gardens, and attractive shops which display shells, delicate mosses, and other treasures of the sea. There are two miles of beautiful beach within the city limits, and in the cliffs beyond, the first sculptor, Neptune has carved grottoes and natural bridges, which richly reward a drive thither, although this natural curiosity does not equal the beauty of La Jolla on the San Diego shore. Congress has been recently petitioned to provide a breakwater for this pleasant bay, that vessels may here find safe and commodious anchorage. On certain days a little steamer crosses from Santa Cruz to Monterey, but to skirt the coast's crescent outline by rail is a three hours' journey.","Susie C.

Salt Lake City,"Salt Lake City, Utah",40.7059,-111.914,Susie C. Clark,1889,"At Palisade, the last place of interest passed before nightfall, some very picturesque scenery is enjoyed, the precipitous rocks on either side being sprinkled with a yellowish moss which resembles copper veining. At this point also a narrow-gauge road diverges to Eureka, where is located the richest gold mine in Nevada. We awake next morning in sight of that strange phenomenon, America's Dead Sea, skirting its borders until we approach Ogden, the terminus of four important railway systems, a city whose beautiful situation we did not have time to inspect as we turn aside here to visit the Mormon Saint's Rest—Salt Lake City. Perhaps no point in our long journey is regarded with a more curious interest than is the capital of Utah. Its strange history, its religion, built upon only nine commandments of the
  Decalogue, its long defiance of U. S. laws, with other unusual features increase one's natural desire to see this strange land. In our first drive about the city it was easy to decide that its beauty had been over-rated. We had heard of wide shaded streets with a gently purling river of pure water from the mountains, bordering every curb-stone. We found a swiftly-flowing muddy current in one gutter only of many of the streets, we found wide thoroughfares, it is true, but they were untidy, rough and ill-kept, and the sidewalks were in no cleanlier condition. The trees were almost wholly of the white locust species, which being now in full flower added a needed touch of grace and beauty to the city, which was also bathed in a clear radiant mountain atmosphere imparting a peculiar brilliancy to the
  sky. A perpetual inspiration is the Wasatch range of snowy peaks, which overlook the city and whose altitude of 13,000 feet it is difficult to realize, being ourselves now nearly 5000 feet above the level of the sea.","Susie C.

Buffalo,"Buffalo, New York",42.8858,-78.8741,Gideon M. Davison,1834,"It is situated at the outlet of Lake Erie. It is a beautiful and thriving town, and with the advantages of both a natural and artificial navigation, is destined to become one of the most important places in the state. Its present population is estimated at upwards of 12,-000, and the number of buildings at rising of 2000. The Erie canal commences in this village, near the outlet of the Buffalo creek, and passes through an extensive and perfectly level plot, equidistant from the shore of the lake and the high grounds called the Terrace. From the canal are cut, at very suitable distances, lateral canals and basins, rendering the whole of the lower town contiguous to water communication. Stores and warehouses are so constructed as to receive the boats along side. In its location, Biiffalo is in the midst of the enterprize and business of this new world. All the manufactures and migrating population from the north and east here find a resting place, and the agricultural products of the west, coming from the long extended lakes, here seek a new avenue to the Atlantic, The lower town is rapidly spreading over that part below the Terrace, where begins a gentle and equal rise of ground, continuing nearly and perhaps quite two miles, and then falls away to a perfect level as far as the eye can reach, bounded only by the horizon. Upon this elevated ground there is a charming view of the lake, Niagara river, the canal with all its branches, the Buffalo creek, the town itself, and the Canada shore; a prospect from which every one parts with reluctance. The streets are very broad, and passing from high grounds over the Terrace to the water, are intersected with cross streets. There are three public squares of some extent, which add much to the beauty of the town. The public buildings are a court-house, situated on the highest part of Main-street, well proportioned and handsomely ornamented. The large park in front of it, which has been recently enclosed and set round with forest trees, will in a short time add much to the beauty of this part of the town.","Gideon M.

The streets are wide and regularly laid out, and the buildings, together with the public squares, of which there are ten, exhibit much taste and elegance. Of the public buildings, the city contains a court house, jail, hospital, theatre, exchange, a public library, 3 banks, and 10 churches.

Some of its streets are extremely beautiful, and many of the houses are truly elegant. Orange trees, in the early part of the season, laden with fruit, and peech trees clothed with blossoms, meet the eye of the traveller, and united with the climate of the country at that time, render Charleston one of the most attractive cities in the union. The society is refined, intelligent, frank and affable. The city was founded and made the seat of government of the state in 1680. It stands on a dead level with the sea, two noble rivers, the Ashley and the Cooper, enclosing it on a wide peninsula called the Neck. Most of the houses contain a piazza, extending from the ground to the top, giving to the rooms in each story a shady open walk.

The newer part of the City is divided into Avenues running nearly parallel with the
  Hudson River, the streets cross them at right angles, and both are simply numbered; the masses of buildings which these sections form are very nearly uniform in area, and are termed blocks. The principal thoroughfare is “Broadway”, which may be said to bisect New York
  longitudinally, it is nearly three miles in length, but the width is not so great as I had imagined. The great place for lounging, or “loafing”, as they term it—is Broadway and here on a fine afternoon you will see some of the neatest feet, some of the prettiest hands, and
  some of the brightest eyes, and also some of the sweetest smiles that any one would ever wish to behold; had they but good figures, the picture would be complete; they dress with Parisian perfection, and in short they are considered the veriest little ducks in the world.
  I am sure the reader will not be surprised when I mention the fact, that “loafing” up and down Broadway is a favourite occupation with the young men who have leisure hours to spare....I must now say a few words respecting the state of the streets; the paving, except in
  Broadway, is not equal to that in the City of London, and doubtless New York is infinitely dirtier than London; I must certainly say it is not so clean as it should be, considering that the sum nominally spent in cleansing the streets, amounts to nearly £60,000 a year.","James H.

This city lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, six miles above their junction; the site however is so low and level, that it does not make a very impressive appearance from any approach. But the elegance, symmetry, and neatness of its streets, and the picturesque character of the higher suburban land to the northward, fully compensate for this want. The streets of Philadelphia, which run north and south from the Schuylkill to the Delaware, are named after the trees, a row whereof grow on each side; but whether from a poetic spirit, or to aid the memory, some of the names are changed, that the following couplet, embracing the eight principal ones, may form a handy guide to the stranger or the resident...The United States Mint is situated in Philadelphia, and there is also a Navy Yard. Many of the bank edifices are very elegant, built of marble and other materials. Churches, Art Societies, and Literary and Scientific Institutions abound in Philadelphia. This city, like many others in America, is liberally supplied with water. Magnificient basins are built in a natural mound at Fairmount, about two miles distant; the water is forced up into these basins from the river by powerful water-wheels, worked by the said river, which is dammed up for the purpose of obtaining sufficient fall, as the stream is sometimes very low.","James H.

The building is on a grand scale, and faced with marble, which glittering in the sunbeams, gives it a very imposing appearance, which will be materially enhanced when the two wings are completed, the corner stone of which was laid in 1851. The Senate Chamber, and the Hall of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, are in the wings of the Capitol, on either side of the central building. The grand rotunda contains eight large pictures, illustrating scenes in American history, painted for the Government by native artists. The corner stone of this splendid structure was laid by Washington himself, Sept: 18th. 1793. The surrounding grounds, which are beautifully cultivated, and embellished by fountains and statuary, embrace from twenty five to thirty acres.

Its central position on the Ohio River has made it a receiving and distributing depot for all the wide and rich country tributary to those great waters.

It commands an extensive view of the Ohio, and of the surrounding country. There are a great number of Churches, and Schools in the city, and also several Benevolent Institutions. Cincinnati is distinguished for the culture of the grape, and it is chiefly owing to the perseverance of Mr. Longworth, that they have been so far successful in producing wine.

The temperature of the cave is uniformly the same, both in summer and winter, viz 59 deg. Fahrenheit, remarkably dry, and of extraordinary salubrity, and hence considered highly beneficial for invalids. A short distance from the entrance you pass the remains of numerous Saltpetre Vats, as in 1814 immense quantities of Saltpetre were manufactured in the Cave, and although the manufacture has been stopped some long time, yet the quantity of nitrous earth still remaining is enormous. The first object of interest is the “Great Vestibule”, this vast chamber has one single unsupported arch, covering an area of one and a half acres of ground.

As early as 1764 St Louis was settled as a trading station for the trappers of the West; four years after it passed from the French into the hands of the Spaniards, who kept possession until it was transferred to the United States in 1804. The rapid increase of St Louis is almost as extraordinary as that of Cincinnati, and perhaps more so, when it is considered, not only that it is further west by hundreds of miles, but that it has to contend with the overflowing of the Mississippi, which has, on more than one occasion, risen to the first floor of the houses and stores built on the edge of the levee; fortunately, the greater part of the town, being built on higher ground, escapes the ruinous periodical inundations. In 1830 the population was under seven thousand, since which date the city has so rapidly increased, that in 1852 its population was bordering on 100,000. The natives of the United States form about one-half of the community, and those of Germany one-fourth; the remainder are chiefly Irish. The public edifices of St Louis, in its municipal buildings, churches, market-houses, and charitable institutions, are certainly creditable to the enterprise of the people. There are about forty churches, one fourth of which are Roman Catholic, many of them are very imposing. There are numerous manufacturing establishments in the city, amongst which flour-mills, and sugar refineries rank the foremost.","James H.

Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.8793,-87.6286,James H. Booty,1859,"Today I amused myself by seeing over Chicago. This is the largest and most important city in Illinois, and in its rapid growth, the most remarkable in the Union. In 1831 it was only an Indian trading post, and as late as 1840 its population did not number 5000, while in 1857 it scarcely fell short of 160,000. The city is on the southern shore of Lake Michigan; the site is an extremely level plain, stretching away for miles in beautiful and fertile prairies. It is divided into three portions by the two branches of the Chicago River, which unite within a mile of the lake. The Michigan and the Wabash Avenues—the one on the lake shore and the other next behind—are noble thoroughfares, in their extent, their architecture, and, more especially, in their fine lines of noble trees; I enjoyed a walk in the afternoon in these beautiful Avenues. The most striking of the public edifices are the Merchants' Exchange and the Court House; I ascended to the summit of the latter and was well repaid for the trouble by the beautiful view of the city and the surrounding country. While I was in Chicago great and ruinous competition was being carried on by the Railway Companies running between that city and New York, (a distance of nearly a thousand miles); tickets were to be had to convey passengers the aforesaid distance for 12 dollars, and this went on for a fortnight....Chicago boasts of numerous very fine buildings, many of the “Stores” rivalling in extent and build with those in New York. It is wonderful to think of the surprising growth of this Western City, and the next few years (by which time they will have completed the improvement in the streets) will doubtless effect still greater strides in this enterprising place.","James H.

Niagara Falls,"Niagara Falls, Ontario",43.0818,-79.0816,James H. Booty,1859,"After the first feelings of mingled awe and delight were over, I began in some degree to realise the sublimity of the scene. What overcomes the visitor at first is the continual roar of the mass of mighty waters, it is perfectly deafening, but as soon as the ear becomes
  accustomed to it, they descend with a lulling and soothing sound. The noise of the Falls is sometimes heard at a very great distance, but of course it is constantly modified by the direction and strength of the wind. The great Lakes of North America—Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie—pour the flood of their accumulated waters into Lake Ontario, through a channel of about 36 miles in length. This channel is named the Niagara River, and is part of the boundary between Canada and the State of New York. Twenty two miles below its commencement at Lake Erie occur these celebrated Falls of Niagara. These Falls are divided into two by Goat Island. The Canadian or Horse-Shoe Fall is in reality Niagara itself, it is 2000 feet wide, and 160 feet high. The American Falls are 900 feet wide, and about 160 feet high, stupendous as they are, they must be considered no more than an offshoot from the main cataract. Over this magnificent precipice it is said the irresistible tide rushes at the rate of a hundred million tons of water every hour! Niagara, according to the testimony of all who dwell near it, is never more beautiful than in the cold midwinter, when no tourists visit it, and when the sides of the chasm are corrugated and adorned with pillars and stalactites of silvery frost; and when huge blocks of ice from Lake Erie, weighing hundreds of tons, are hurled down the Rapids and over the Falls, as if they were of no greater specific gravity than feathers or human bodies, and reappear half a mile lower down the river, shivered to numberless fragments. It is a tradition of Niagara that, in 1822 or 1823, such a thick wall of ice was formed above Goat Island that no water flowed past for several hours, and that in the interval the precipice at the Horse Shoe Fall was perfectly bare and dry. A picture of the scene, painted at the time, is still in existence.","James H. Booty, Three Months in Canada and the United States (London: James H.

Montreal,"Montreal, Quebec",45.4955,-73.5755,James H. Booty,1859,"It is one of the most ancient cities on the North American Continent, having been founded in 1642. It contains a population of 75,000. It is not only a beautiful but a solidly-built city, and wears a general air and aspect of strength befitting the climate. By the French Roman Catholics, who form nearly one half of the population, it is called affectionately the Ville Marie, or town of the Virgin Mary; the names of its principal streets, derived from those of the Saints in the Romish Calendar, testify alike to the fervency and to the faith of its founders. The quays of Montreal are unsurpassed by those of any city in America; built of solid limestone, and uniting with the locks and cut stone wharves of the Lachine Canal, they display for several miles a mass of continuous masonry. Unlike the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi, no unsightly warehouses disfigure the river side. A broad terrace, faced with gray limestone, the parapets of which are surmounted with a substantial iron railing, divides the city from the river throughout its whole length. Amongst the public buildings, the most remarkable is the Roman Catholic Cathedral; of the vastness of the interior of this edifice, an idea may be formed from the fact that it is capable of accommodating nearly 12,000 persons. The view from the summit of its towers, one of which I ascended embracing the city and its suburbs, the river, and the surrounding country—is exceedingly beautiful. Other elegant public edifices claim the attention of the visitor, also numerous banks, nunneries, and churches: all of these buildings are erected in a most durable manner.","James H.

Quebec,"Québec City, Quebec",46.8101,-71.2218,James H. Booty,1859,"Quebec is the capital of United Canada, and after Montreal, the most populous city in British North America; it is the quaintest and most remarkable city in the New World—picturesque as Edinburgh and strong as Gibraltar. Everybody who has seen or read of Quebec must remember the magnificent towering rock overhanging the river, on the summit of which the citadel is placed, forming at once the chief stronghold of its defence, and the grandest feature of its scenery. The city is divided into two sections, called the Upper and the Lower Towns; the Upper Town occupying the highest part of the promontory, which is surrounded by strong walls and other fortifications; and the Lower Town, being built around the base of Cape Diamond. The latter is the business quarter. I had not been many hours in Quebec before I stood at the wall of the citadel, overlooking the river from a dizzy height of 300 feet—the standard of Great Britain floating over my head; the red-coated soldiers of my native land pacing their rounds, and suggesting, by their general appearance, the dear old country, from which I was separated by so many thousand miles of ocean; and on the soil of whose noble colony I stood, and felt that I was no longer a “foreigner”, as I was sometimes reminded when in the United States. The Citadel with its numerous buildings covers about 40 acres; its impregnable position makes it perhaps the strongest fortresa on the American Continent. The view from the citadel is most lovely, taking in, as it does, the opposite banks of the great river for nearly 50 miles up and down. I heard it said, that a gentleman once remarked, that the only scene he knew more glorious than that which meets the eye from the citadel at Quebec was Rio Janeiro, which he believed to be by far the grandest in the world; but the Rio lacks the associations of Quebec. Who could forget that beneath its walls two chieftains, the bravest of the brave, fell on the same battle field.","James H. Booty, Three Months in Canada and the United States (London: James H.

 The fog during the night grew so dense that Paulo da Gama lost sight of the captain-major, and when day broke [July 17] we saw neither him nor the other vessels. We therefore made sail for the Cape Verde islands, as we had been instructed to do in case of becoming separated.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

They, too, had lost sight of the captain-major. Having joined company we pursued our route, but the wind fell, and we were becalmed until Wednesday [July 26]. At ten o’clock on that day we sighted the captain-major, about five leagues ahead of us, and having got speech with him in the evening we gave expression to our joy by many times firing off our bombards and sounding the trumpets.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

Santa Helena,South Africa,-32.75054,18.00355,Vasco da Gama,1497,"On Tuesday [November 7] we returned to the land, which we found to be low, with a broad bay opening into it. The captain-major sent Pero d’Alenquer in a boat to take soundings and to search for good anchoring ground. The bay was found to be very clean, and to afford shelter against all winds except those from the N.W. It extended east and west, and we named it Santa Helena.
 
 On Wednesday [November 8] we cast anchor in this bay, and we remained there eight days, cleaning the ships, mending the sails, and taking in wood.
 
 The river Samtiagua [S. Thiago] enters the bay four 6 leagues to the S.E. of the anchorage. It comes from the interior (sertão), is about a stone’s throw across at the mouth, and from two to three fathoms in depth at all states of the tide.

Cape of Good Hope,South Africa,-34.35684,18.47398,Vasco da Gama,1497,"At daybreak of Thursday the 16th of November, having careened our ships and taken in wood, we set sail. At that time we did not know how far we might be abaft the Cape of Good Hope. Pero d’Alenquer thought the distance about thirty leagues, but he was not certain, for on his return voyage [when with B. Dias] he had left the Cape in the morning and had gone past this bay with the wind astern, whilst on the outward voyage he had kept at sea, and was therefore unable to identify the locality where we now were. We therefore stood out towards the S.S.W. and late on Saturday [November 18] we beheld the Cape. On that same day we again stood out to sea, returning to the land in the course of the night. On Sunday morning, November 19, we once more made for the Cape, but were again unable to round it, for the wind blew from the S.S.W., whilst the Cape juts out towards the S.W. We then again stood out to sea, returning to the land on Monday night. At last, on Wednesday [November 22], at noon, having the wind astern, we succeeded in doubling the Cape, and then ran along the coast.
 
 To the south of this Cape of Good Hope, and close to it, a vast bay, six leagues broad at its mouth, enters about six leagues into the land.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

“Seal” Islan,South Africa,-34.17473,22.0834,Vasco da Gama,1497,"Late on Saturday, November 25, the day of St. Catherine’s, we entered the bay (angra) of Sam Brás, where we remained for thirteen days, for there we broke up our store-ship and transferred her contents to the other vessels.
 [...]
 There is an island in this bay, three bowshots from the land, where there are many seals. Some of these are as big as bears, very formidable, with large tusks. These attack man, and no spear, whatever the force with which it is thrown, can wound them. There are others much smaller and others quite small. And whilst the big ones roar like lions, the little ones cry like goats. One day, when we approached this island for our amusement, we counted, among large and small ones, three thousand, and we fired among them with our bombards from the sea. On the same island there are birds as big as ducks, but they cannot fly, because they have no feathers on their wings. These birds, of whom we killed as many as we chose, are called Fotylicayos, and they bray like asses.
 
 On Friday [December 1], whilst still in the bay of Sam Brás, about ninety men resembling those we had met at St. Helena Bay made their appearance. Some of them walked along the beach, whilst others remained upon the hills.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

 The town of Malindi lies in a bay and extends along the shore.

The coast there runs north and south, and the land encloses a huge bay with a strait. 47In this bay,136 we were told, were to be found many large cities of Christians and Moors, including one called Quambay [Cambay], as also six-hundred known islands, and within it the Red Sea and the “house” [Kaabah] of Mecca.

 On Friday, the 18th of May,after having seen no land for twenty-three days, we sighted lofty mountains, and having all this time sailed before the wind we could not have made less than 600 leagues. The land, when first sighted, was at a distance of eight leagues, and our lead reached bottom at forty-five fathoms. That same night we took a course to the S.S.W., so as to get away from the coast.

Calecut,India,11.25875,75.78041,Vasco da Gama,1498,"[A description of Calecut.] The city of Calecut is inhabited by Christians. They are of a tawny complexion. Some of them have big beards and long hair, whilst others clip their hair short or shave the head, merely allowing a tuft to remain on the crown as a sign that they are Christians. They also wear moustaches. They pierce the ears and wear much gold in them. They go naked down to the waist, covering their lower extremities with very fine cotton stuffs. But it is only the most respectable who do this, for the others manage as best they are able.
 
 [...]
 
 [Christian Church.] When we arrived [at Calecut] they took us to a large church, and this is what we saw:—
 
 The body of the church is as large as a monastery, all built of hewn stone and covered with tiles. At the main entrance rises a pillar of bronze as high as a mast, on the top of which was perched a bird, apparently a cock. In addition to this, there was another pillar as high as a man, and very stout. In the centre of the body of the church rose a chapel, all built of hewn stone, with a bronze door sufficiently wide for a man to pass, and stone steps leading up to it. Within this sanctuary stood a small image which they said represented Our Lady. Along the walls, by the main entrance, hung seven small bells. In this church the captain-major said his prayers, and we with him.
 
 We did not go within the chapel, for it is the custom that only certain servants of the church, called quafees,161 should enter. These quafees wore some threads passing over the left shoulder and under the right arm, in the same manner as our deacons wear the stole. They threw holy water over us, and gave us some white earth, which the Christians of this country are in the habit of putting on their foreheads, breasts, around the neck, and on the forearms. They threw holy water upon the captain-major and gave him some of the earth, which he gave in charge of someone, giving them to understand that he would put it on later.
 
 Many other saints were painted on the walls of the church, wearing crowns. They were painted variously, with teeth protruding an inch from the mouth, and four or five arms.
 
 Below this church there was a large masonry tank, similar to many others which we had seen along the road.
 
 [...]
 
 [Progress through the Town.] After we had left that place, and had arrived at the entrance to the city [of Calecut] we were shown another church, where we saw things like those described above. Here the crowd grew so dense that progress along the street became next to impossible, and for this reason they put the captain into a house, and us with him.
 
 The king sent a brother of the bale, who was a lord of this country, to accompany the captain, and he was attended by men beating drums, blowing anafils and bagpipes, and firing off matchlocks. In conducting the captain they showed us much respect, more than is shown in Spain to a king. The number of people was countless, for in addition to those who surrounded us, and among whom there were two thousand armed men, they crowded the roofs and houses.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

Calecut,India,11.25875,75.78041,Vasco da Gama,1498,"[The King’s Palace.] The further we advanced in the direction of the king’s palace, the more did they increase in number. And when we arrived there, men of much distinction and great lords came out to meet the captain, and joined those who were already in attendance upon him. It was then an hour before sunset. When we reached the palace we passed through a gate into a courtyard of great size, and before we arrived at where the king was, we passed four doors, through which we had to force our way, giving many blows to the people. When, at last, we reached the door where the king was, there came forth from it a little old man, who holds a position resembling that of a bishop, and whose advice the king acts upon in all affairs of the church. This man embraced the captain when he entered the door. Several men were wounded at this door, and we only got in by the use of much force.
 
 [A Royal Audience, May 28.] The king was in a small court, reclining upon a couch covered with a cloth of green velvet, above which was a good mattress, and upon this again a sheet of cotton stuff, very white and fine, more so than any linen. The cushions were after the same fashion. In his left hand the king held a very large golden cup [spittoon], having a capacity of half an almude [8 pints]. At its mouth this cup was two palmas [16 inches] wide, and apparently it was massive. Into this cup the king threw the husks of a certain herb which is chewed by the people of this country because of its soothing effects, and which they call atambor. On the right side of the king stood a basin of gold, so large that a man might just encircle it with his arms: this contained the herbs. There were likewise many silver jugs. The canopy above the couch was all gilt.","Vasco De Gama, A Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama 1497-1499, trans.

 The tombs of Khojeh Abdullah Ahrar, of Abul Mansur Maturidi, of the author of the Bedaya, and other eminent and illustrious men are also to be seen here.
 
 Samarkand is defended by a mud wall, as well as a citadel of earth. The interior of the fort is inhabited, as well as the suburb; in the centre of the city is a large hexagonal building, surmounted by a cupola, and in each angle is a market. There are many large colleges in the city; the largest is the Madressa Khanum, but it is now in ruins. Some of the colleges are still maintained, as those of Shirnak and Tilakari, founded by Baling tosh Beg; the principal of the Shir nak college is named Abu Sayid; he is the chief cazy also, and is one of the most learned and amiable men in Samarkand. The Tilakari college has two principals and two scholars. Opposite to the Shir nak college is that of Ulugh Beg, in which is the chamber of Mullah Jami.
 
 The Governor of Samarkand is Dowlet Be Kushbegi. Before
 the reign of Shah Murad Be, Samarkand was in an entirely dilapidated condition, and the colleges were haunted by lions and wolves. Shah Murad by great exertion repeopled the city, and it increases daily in population. There are two markets a week, on Sunday and Thursday. Horses of the Bokhara breed are cheap. The situation and climate of this city are delightful, and running streams supply it with water. A variety of tribes are to be met with in the neighbourhood, as Mohammedans from China, and Kapchaks, and Karakalpaks; formerly, perhaps, they were scattered in different cities, but they are now collected, and are all called Usbeks. The weight of Samarkand is, one tila, equal to one miskal, but the market miskal is equal to five tilas ; five bazar miskals are one gharribek, two gharribek make one pashezek, two pashezeks one yetimék, two yetiméks one nimkhora, two nimkhoras are one nim charek, two nimchareks one charek, four chareks one seer, sixteen seers one maund. Weights were formerly differently reckoned, but they have been fixed
 at these rates during the last two years.","Mir Izzet Ullah, ""Travels beyond the Himalaya,"" The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 7, no. 2 (1843): 329-330.",https://archive.org/details/jstor-25207624,Uzbekistan,Western Asia,Asia
Bokhara,Bukhara,39.76808,64.45557,Mir Izzet Ullah,1813,"The city Bokhara, two hours west. Bokhara is surrounded by a mud wall, and contains a citadel within which the king resides. The city abounds with squares and markets, and the suburbs with gardens. The inhabitants of Bokhara are natives of Iran, and Rüm, and Nogais from Russia, and people from Kabul, and Peshawer, attracted thither by the good government of Mir Hyder and the perfect security of travelling. There are many colleges and students. Each college has endowments in land; besides which the king gives personal allowances to the teachers and disciples, out of the Máli Zikat, (or tax levied for charitable purposes) the rest of which is invariably distributed amongst the needy and distressed, and never goes into the royal coffers. All the affairs of the state are conducted by the king himself, without the assistance of any principal ministers, except Hakim Be, who when the king goes out from the city on any journey, is left in charge of the citadel and the administration of affairs. The collection of the Máli Zikat, and other imposts, is in the hands of Hakim Be also, under supervisal of the king: no other officer of the state has equal authority.
 
 There is a market for horses four days in each week. On Saturday, Monday, and Thursday, it is held in the city, on the side of the gate of the desert near the citadel: on Wednesday, it occurs without the city near the tomb of Baha-ud-din. Horses of no value only are brought to market, their price is from ten to fifteen tilas: horses of higher cost, or from 100 to 150 tilas, are to be had of the dealers at their own houses, and are brought by brokers for inspection: but there are very few, and it would be difficult at any one time to collect from fifty to one hundred horses of this class.
 
 [The text goes on for several paragraphs about horses and camels before moving toward politics. There is some interest in connections with Russia.]
 
 The tombs of Bokhara, either in the city or in its neighbourhood, are very numerous: amongst them are those of Hezret Said Amir Kulal, Khajeh Beha-ud-din of Nakshebend, Imam Abu Hefs Kabir, and Imam Ahmed Ghazali, of the author of the Shereh Wakaya, of Baba Paradoz (the darner) of Hezret Imlah and of Shah Murad Be Wali Niami; this last has no dome nor turrets: they say that the earth from this last tomb has many healing
 qualities.
 
 [Text about some of the surrounding territory.]
 
 The houses of Bokhara are like those of Peshawer; they are built of unbaked bricks, and are two or three stories high; the walls are thin and are strengthened with wooden buttresses: the markets are mostly covered in, and there are several Serais for the accommodationn of merchants, as the serai of Alem Khan, where the Hindus from Shikarpur and other places alight. The hire of a chamber is one tila per month: the Hindu traders pay also the jezia to the king. They bring indigo chiefly, and tobacco. Another serai is the Nogha-i, where the Nogay and other traders put up: the Nogays are Musselmans subject to Russia, some of them are residents in Bokhara. There are about fifty druggists' shops in the city; but no skilful physician-the practitioners are all ignorant of the science; and when any medical professor comes along with the merchants from Peshawer or other places, he is held in very high estimation. The most common disease is the rishteh, (Guinea worm) and few people are free from it, like colds in Hindustan in the winter season; the people of Bokhara are very dexterous in the treatment of it, and extract it by incision, in this manner : if the head of the rishteh be near the wrist and the tail near the elbow, they carry the finger along it, to ascertain its course, and then lay the skin open with a lancet for three or four fingers breadth, a little below the head, which they draw back to the place where the incision began; they then make another incision of a similar kind, and so proceed gradually till they come to the origin of the worm, and remove it entirely. Other complaints are fevers, leprosy, and affections of the bowels. It happens sometimes, that where the physicians have engaged to cure the sick, and the patient has died, the heirs have demanded the price of blood; in that case the king has declared that when the physician knows his profession, he shall be held
 acquitted; but if he proves an ignoramus he is condemned to pay
 the usual amercement--these cases are too frequent to be much
 attended to; but a physician leads but an uncomfortable sort of
 life in Bokhara.","Mir Izzet Ullah, ""Travels beyond the Himalaya,"" The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 7, no. 2 (1843): 331-342.",https://archive.org/details/jstor-25207625,Uzbekistan,Western Asia,Asia

Since that time we have had wind enough in all conscience—lovely breezes as the mate called them. But we have oversailed our mark; and by how much no man on board this vessel can tell. Neither the captain nor the mate were ever in Cien Fuegos before; and I begin to doubt whether they ever will be there. No one knows where we are. An old stove has, it seems, been stowed away right under the compass, giving a false bias to the needle, so that our only guide guides us wrong. There is not a telescope on board. I very much doubt the skipper's power of taking an observation, though he certainly goes through the form of holding a machine like a brazen spider up to his eye about midday.

So much it may be well that I should say, in order that my apparently purposeless wanderings may be understood to have had some method in them.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,England,West Europe,Europe
St. Thomas,St. Thomas,18.33809,-64.89409,Anthony Trollope,1858,"And in the good ship 'Atrato' I reached that emporium of travellers, St. Thomas, on the 2nd of December. We had awfully bad weather, of course, and the ship did wonders. When men write their travels, the weather has always been bad, and the ship has always done wonders. We thought ourselves very uncomfortable—I, for one, now know better—and abused the company, and the captain, and the purser, and the purveyor, and the stewards every day at breakfast and dinner; not always with the eloquence of the Frenchman and his walnut, but very frequently with quite equal energy. But at the end of our journey we were all smiles, and so was the captain. He was tender to the ladies and cordial to the gentlemen; and we, each in our kind, reciprocated his attention. On the whole, O my readers! if you are going to the West Indies, you may do worse than go in the 'Atrato.' But do not think too much of your withered apples.
 
 I landed at St. Thomas, where we lay for some hours; and as I put my foot on the tropical soil for the first time, a lady handed me a rose, saying, ""That's for love, dear."" I took it, and said that it should be for love. She was beautifully, nay, elegantly dressed. Her broad-brimmed hat was as graceful as are those of Ryde or Brighton. The well-starched skirts of her muslin dress gave to her upright figure that look of easily compressible bulk, which, let 'Punch' do what it will, has become so sightly to our eyes. Pink gloves were on her hands. ""That's for love, dear."" Yes, it shall be for love; for thee and thine, if I can find that thou deservest it. What was it to me that she was as black as my boot, or that she had come to look after the ship's washing?
 
 I shall probably have a word or two to say about St. Thomas; but not now. It is a Niggery-Hispano-Dano-Yankee-Doodle place; in which, perhaps, the Yankee-Doodle element, declaring itself in nasal twang and sherry cobblers, seems to be of the strongest flavour; as undoubtedly will be the case in many of these parts as years go on revolving. That nasal twang will sound as the Bocca Romana in coming fashionable western circles; those sherry cobblers will be the Falernian drink of a people masters of half the world. I dined at the hotel, but should have got a better dinner on board the 'Atrato,' in spite of the withered apples.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Kingston Harbor,Kingston Harbor,17.95254,-76.805,Anthony Trollope,1858,"From St. Thomas we went to Kingston, Jamaica, in the 'Derwent.' We were now separated from the large host of Spaniards who had come with us, going to Peru, the Spanish Main, Mexico, Cuba, or Porto Rico; and, to tell the truth, we were not broken-hearted on the occasion.
 
 [...]
 
 Kingston harbour is a large lagune, formed by a long narrow bank of sand which runs out into the sea, commencing some three or four miles above the town of Kingston, and continuing parallel with the coast on which Kingston is built till it reaches a point some five or six miles below Kingston. This sandbank is called ""The Palisades,"" and the point or end of it is Port Royal. This is the seat of naval supremacy for Jamaica, and, as far as England is concerned, for the surrounding islands and territories. And here lies our flag-ship; and here we maintain a commodore, a dock-yard, a naval hospital, a pile of invalided anchors, and all the usual adjuncts of such an establishment. Some years ago—I am not good at dates, but say seventy, if you will—Port Royal was destroyed by an earthquake.
 
 Those who are geographically inclined should be made to understand that the communication between Port Royal and Kingston, as, indeed, between Port Royal and any other part of the island, is by water. It is, I believe, on record that hardy Subs, and hardier Mids, have ridden along the Palisades, and not died from sun-stroke in the effort. But the chances are much against them. The ordinary ingress and egress is by water. The ferry boats usually take about an hour, and the charge is a shilling. The writer of these pages, however, has been two hours and a quarter in the transit.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

The bad weather was at an end, and all our nautical troubles nearly over; so we ate and drank and smoked and danced, and swore mutual friendship, till the officer of the Board of Health visited us as we rounded the point at Port Royal, and again ruffled our tempers by delaying us for some thirty minutes under a broiling sun.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Kingston,Kingston,18.01787,-76.8099,Anthony Trollope,1858,"Were it arranged by Fate that my future residence should be in Jamaica, I should certainly prefer the life of a country mouse. The town mice, in my mind, have but a bad time of it. Of all towns that I ever saw, Kingston is perhaps, on the whole, the least alluring, and is the more absolutely without any point of attraction for the stranger than any other.
 
 It is built down close to the sea—or rather, on the lagune which forms the harbour, has a southern aspect, and is hot even in winter. I have seen the thermometer considerably above eighty in the shade in December, and the mornings are peculiarly hot, so that there is no time at which exercise can be taken with comfort. At about 10 a.m., a sea breeze springs up, which makes it somewhat cooler than it is two hours earlier—that is, cooler in the houses. The sea breeze, however, is not of a nature to soften the heat of the sun, or to make it even safe to walk far at that hour. Then, in the evening, there is no twilight, and when the sun is down it is dark. The stranger will not find it agreeable to walk much about Kingston in the dark.
 
 Indeed, the residents in the town, and in the neighbourhood of the town, never walk. Men, even young men, whose homes are some mile or half-mile distant from their offices, ride or drive to their work as systematically as a man who lives at Watford takes the railway.
 
 Kingston, on a map—for there is a map even of Kingston—looks admirably well. The streets all run in parallels. There is a fine large square, plenty of public buildings, and almost a plethora of places of worship. Everything is named with propriety, and there could be no nicer town anywhere. But this word of promise to the ear is strangely broken when the performance is brought to the test. More than half the streets are not filled with houses. Those which are so filled, and those which are not, have an equally rugged, disreputable, and bankrupt appearance. The houses are mostly of wood, and are unpainted, disjointed, and going to ruin. Those which are built with brick not unfrequently appear as though the mortar had been diligently picked out from the interstices.
 
 But the disgrace of Jamaica is the causeway of the streets themselves. There never was so odious a place in which to move. There is no pathway or trottoir to the streets, though there is very generally some such—I cannot call it accommodation—before each individual house. But as these are all broken from each other by steps up and down, as they are of different levels, and sometimes terminate abruptly without any steps, they cannot be used by the public. One is driven, therefore, into the middle of the street. But the street is neither paved nor macadamized, nor prepared for traffic in any way. In dry weather it is a bed of sand, and in wet weather it is a watercourse. Down the middle of this the unfortunate pedestrian has to wade, with a tropical sun on his head; and this he must do in a town which, from its position, is hotter than almost any other in the West Indies. It is no wonder that there should be but little walking.
 
 But the stranger does not find himself naturally in possession of a horse and carriage. He may have a saddle-horse for eight shillings; but that is expensive as well as dilatory if he merely wishes to call at the post-office, or buy a pair of gloves. There are articles which they call omnibuses, and which ply cheap enough, and carry men to any part of the town for sixpence; that is, they will do so if you can find them. They do not run from any given point to any other, but meander about through the slush and sand, and are as difficult to catch as the musquitoes.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Spanish Town,Spanish Town,18.01668,-76.97481,Anthony Trollope,1858,"That which tends in part to the desolation of Kingston—or rather, to put the proposition in a juster form, which prevents Kingston from enjoying those advantages which would naturally attach to the metropolis of the island—is this: the seat of government is not there, but at Spanish Town. Then our naval establishment is at Port Royal.
 
 [...]
 
 New York, probably, might be no whit improved were the National Congress to be held there; nor Amsterdam, perhaps, if the Hague were abandoned; but it would be a great thing for Kingston if Spanish Town were deserted.
 
 The Governor lives at the latter place, as do also those satellites or moons who revolve round the larger luminary—the secretaries, namely, and executive officers. These in Jamaica are now so reduced in size that they could not perhaps do much for any city; but they would do a little, and to Kingston any little would be acceptable. Then the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly sit at Spanish Town, and the members—at any rate of the latter body—are obliged to live there during some three months of the year, not generally in very comfortable lodgings.
 
 Respectable residents in the island, who would pay some attention to the Governor if he lived at the principal town, find it impossible to undergo the nuisance of visiting Spanish Town, and in this way go neither to the one nor the other, unless when passing through Kingston on their biennial or triennial visits to the old country.
 
 And those visits to Spanish Town are indeed a nuisance. In saying this, I reflect in no way on the Governor or the Governor's people. Were Gabriel Governor of Jamaica, with only five thousand pounds a year, and had he a dozen angels with him as secretaries and aides-de-camp, mortal men would not go to them at Spanish Town after they had once seen of what feathers their wings were made.
 
 It is like the city of the dead. There are long streets there in which no human inhabitant is ever seen. In others a silent old negro woman may be sitting at an open door, or a child playing, solitary, in the dust. The Governor's house—King's House as it is called—stands on one side of a square; opposite is the house of the Assembly; on the left, as you come out from the Governor's, are the executive offices and house of the Council, and on the right some other public buildings. The place would have some pretension about it did it not seem to be stricken with an eternal death. All the walls are of a dismal dirty yellow, and a stranger cannot but think that the colour is owing to the dreadfully prevailing disease of the country. In this square there are no sounds; men and women never frequent it; nothing enters it but sunbeams—and such sunbeams! The glare from those walls seems to forbid that men and women should come there.
 
 The parched, dusty, deserted streets are all hot and perfectly without shade. The crafty Italians have built their narrow streets so that the sun can hardly enter them, except when he is in the mid heaven; but there has been no such craft at Spanish Town. The houses are very low, and when there is any sun in the heavens it can enter those streets; and in those heavens there is always a burning, broiling sun.
 
 But the place is not wholly deserted. There is here the most frightfully hideous race of pigs that ever made a man ashamed to own himself a bacon-eating biped. I have never done much in pigs myself, but I believe that pigly grace consists in plumpness and comparative shortness—in shortness, above all, of the face and nose. The Spanish Town pigs are never plump. They are the very ghosts of swine, consisting entirely of bones and bristles. Their backs are long, their ribs are long, their legs are long, but, above all, their heads and noses are hideously long. These brutes prowl about in the sun, and glare at the unfrequent strangers with their starved eyes, as though doubting themselves whether, by some little exertion, they might not become beasts of prey.
 
 The necessity which exists for white men going to Spanish Town to see the Governor results, I do not doubt, in some deaths every year. I will describe the first time I was thus punished. Spanish Town is thirteen miles from Kingston, and the journey is accomplished by railway in somewhat under an hour. The trains run about every four hours. On my arrival a public vehicle took me from the station up to King's House, and everything seemed to be very convenient. The streets, certainly, were rather dead, and the place hot; but I was under cover, and the desolation did not seem to affect me. When I was landed on the steps of the government-house, the first idea of my coming sorrows flitted across my mind. ""Where shall I call for you?"" said the driver; ""the train goes at a quarter past four."" It was then one: and where was he to call for me? and what was I to do with myself for three hours? ""Here,"" I said; ""on these steps."" What other place could I name? I knew no other place in Spanish Town.

Jamaica (countryside),Jamaica (countryside),18.10958,-77.2975,Anthony Trollope,1858,"I have spoken in disparaging terms of the chief town in Jamaica, but I can atone for this by speaking in very high terms of the country. In that island one would certainly prefer the life of the country mouse. There is scenery in Jamaica which almost equals that of Switzerland and the Tyrol; and there is also, which is more essential, a temperature among the mountains in which a European can live comfortably.
 
 I travelled over the greater part of the island, and was very much pleased with it. The drawbacks on such a tour are the expensiveness of locomotion, the want of hotels, and the badness of the roads. As to cost, the tourist always consoles himself by reflecting that he is going to take the expensive journey once, and once only. The badness of the roads forms an additional excitement; and the want of hotels is cured, as it probably has been caused, by the hospitality of the gentry.
 
 [...]
 
 It is of course known that the sugar-cane is the chief production of Jamaica; but one may travel for days in the island and only see a cane piece here and there. By far the greater portion of the island is covered with wild wood and jungle—what is there called bush. Through this, on an occasional favourable spot, and very frequently on the roadsides, one sees the gardens or provision-grounds of the negroes. These are spots of land cultivated by them, for which they either pay rent, or on which, as is quite as common, they have squatted without payment of any rent.
 
 These provision-grounds are very picturesque. They are not filled, as a peasant's garden in England or in Ireland is filled, with potatoes and cabbages, or other vegetables similarly uninteresting in their growth; but contain cocoa-trees, breadfruit-trees, oranges, mangoes, limes, plantains, jack fruit, sour-sop, avocado pears, and a score of others, all of which are luxuriant trees, some of considerable size, and all of them of great beauty. The breadfruit-tree and the mango are especially lovely, and I know nothing prettier than a grove of oranges in Jamaica. In addition to this, they always have the yam, which is with the negro somewhat as the potato is with the Irishman; only that the Irishman has nothing else, whereas the negro generally has either fish or meat, and has also a score of other fruits besides the yam.
 
 The yam, too, is picturesque in its growth. As with the potato, the root alone is eaten, but the upper part is fostered and cared for as a creeper, so that the ground may be unencumbered by its thick tendrils. Support is provided for it as for grapes or peas. Then one sees also in these provision-grounds patches of coffee and arrowroot, and occasionally also patches of sugar-cane.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Rivers,Rivers in Jamaia,18.0778,-77.76135,Anthony Trollope,1858,"A man wishing to see the main features of the whole island, and proceeding from Kingston as his head-quarters, must take two distinct tours, one to the east and the other to the west. The former may be best done on horseback, as the roads are, one may say, non-existent for a considerable portion of the way, and sometimes almost worse than non-existent in other places.
 
 One of the most remarkable characteristics of Jamaica is the copiousness of its rivers. It is said that its original name, Xaymaca, signifies a country of streams; and it certainly is not undeserved. This copiousness, though it adds to the beauty, as no doubt it does also to its salubrity and fertility, adds something too to the difficulty of locomotion. Bridges have not been built, or, sad to say, have been allowed to go to destruction. One hears that this river or that river is ""down,"" whereby it is signified that the waters are swollen; and some of the rivers when so down are certainly not easy of passage. Such impediments are more frequent in the east than elsewhere, and on this account travelling on horseback is the safest as well as the most expeditious means of transit. I found four horses to be necessary, one for the groom, one for my clothes, and two for myself.

Port Antonio,Port Antonio,18.17127,-76.44763,Anthony Trollope,1858,"We went across the island to a little village called Annotta Bay, traversing the Waag-water twenty-four times, as I have said; and from thence, through the parishes of Metcalf and St. George, to Port Antonio. ""Fuit ilium et ingens gloria."" This may certainly be said of Port Antonio and the adjacent district. It was once a military station, and the empty barracks, standing so beautifully over the sea, on an extreme point of land, are now waiting till time shall reduce them to ruin. The place is utterly desolate, though not yet broken up in its desolation, as such buildings quickly become when left wholly untenanted. A rusty cannon or two still stand at the embrasures, watching the entrance to the fort; and among the grass we found a few metal balls, the last remains of the last ordnance supplies.
 
 But Port Antonio was once a goodly town, and the country round it, the parish of Portland, is as fertile as any in the island. But now there is hardly a sugar estate in the whole parish. It is given up to the growth of yams, cocoas, and plantains. It has become a provision-ground for negroes, and the palmy days of the town are of course gone.
 
 [...]
 
 I had another adventure at Port Antonio. About two o'clock in the morning there was an earthquake, and we were all nearly shaken out of our beds. Some one rushed into my room, declaring that not a stone would be left standing of Port Royal. There were two distinct blows, separated by some seconds, and a loud noise was heard. I cannot say that I was frightened, as I had not time to realize the fact of the earthquake before it was all over. No harm was done, I believe, anywhere, beyond the disseverance of a little plaster from the walls.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

Here I saw a plain of about four thousand acres under canes. It looked to be prosperous; but I was told by the planter with whom I was staying that the land had lately been deluged with water; that the canes were covered with mud; and that the crops would be very short.

The distances here were longer, but the journey was made on wheels, and was not so fatiguing. Moreover, I stayed some little time with a friend in one of the distant parishes of the island. The scenery during the whole expedition was very grand. The road goes through Spanish Town, and then divides itself, one road going westward by the northern coast, and the other by that to the south. I went by the former, and began my journey by the bog or bogue walk, a road through a magnificent ravine, and then over Mount Diabolo. The Devil assumes to himself all the finest scenery in all countries. Of a delicious mountain tarn he makes his punch-bowl; he loves to leap from crag to crag over the wildest ravines; he builds picturesque bridges in most impassable sites; and makes roads over mountains at gradients not to be attempted by the wildest engineer.

I cannot say that the streets are alive with trade; but they do not appear to be so neglected, desolate, and wretched as the metropolis or the seat of government.

Hanover (parish),Hanover Parish,18.40977,-78.13363,Anthony Trollope,1858,"The two furthermost parishes of Jamaica are Hanover and Westmoreland, and I stayed for a short time with a gentleman who lives on the borders of the two. I certainly was never in a more lovely country. He was a sugar planter; but the canes and sugar, which, after all, are ugly and by no means savoury appurtenances, were located somewhere out of sight. As far as I myself might know, from what I saw, my host's ordinary occupations were exactly those of a country gentleman in England. He fished and shot, and looked after his estate, and acted as a magistrate; and over and above this, was somewhat particular about his dinner, and the ornamentation of the land immediately round his house. I do not know that Fate can give a man a pleasanter life. If, however, he did at unseen moments inspect his cane-holes, and employ himself among the sugar hogsheads and rum puncheons, it must be acknowledged that he had a serious drawback on his happiness.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Knockalva,"Knockalva District, Ramble",18.3252,-77.99539,Anthony Trollope,1858,"I saw various grazing farms—pens they are here called—while I was in this part of the country; and I could not but fancy that grazing should in Jamaica be the natural and most beneficial pursuit of the proprietor, as on the other side of the Atlantic it certainly is in Ireland. I never saw grass to equal the guinea grass in some of the parishes; and at Knockalva I looked at Hereford cattle which I have rarely, if ever, seen beaten at any agricultural show in England. At present the island does not altogether supply itself with meat; but it might do so, and supply, moreover, nearly the whole of the remaining West Indies. Proprietors of land say that the sea transit is too costly. Of course it is at present; the trade not yet existing; for indeed, at present there is no means of such transit. But screw steamers now always appear quickly enough wherever freight offers itself; and if the cattle were there, they would soon find their way down to the Windward Islands.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Newcastle,Newcastle JDF Camp,18.07254,-76.71453,Anthony Trollope,1858,"I took a third expedition up to Newcastle, where are placed the barracks for our white troops, to the Blue Mountain peak, and to various gentlemen's houses in these localities. For grandeur of scenery this is the finest part of the island. The mountains are far too abrupt, and the land too much broken for those lovely park-like landscapes of which the parishes of Westmoreland and Hanover are full, and of which Stuttlestone, the property of Lord Howard de Walden, is perhaps the most beautiful specimen. But nothing can be grander, either in colour or grouping, than the ravines of the Blue Mountain ranges of hills. Perhaps the finest view in the island is from Raymond Lodge, a house high up among the mountains, in which—so local rumour says—'Tom Cringle's Log' was written.
 
 [...]
 
 I have hunted in Carmarthenshire, and a man who has done that ought to be able to ride anywhere; but in riding over some of these razorback crags, my heart, though it did not faint visibly, did almost do so invisibly. However, we got safely to Newcastle, and our fair friends returned over the same route with no other escort than that of a black groom. In spite of the crags the ride was not unpleasant.
 
 One would almost enlist as a full private in one of her Majesty's regiments of the line if one were sure of being quartered for ever at Newcastle—at Newcastle, Jamaica, I mean. Other Newcastles of which I wot have by no means equal attraction. This place also is accessible only by foot or on horseback; and is therefore singularly situated for a barrack. But yet it consists now of a goodly village, in which live colonels, and majors, and chaplains, and surgeons, and purveyors, all in a state of bliss—as it were in a second Eden. It is a military paradise, in which war is spoken of, and dinners and dancing abound. If good air and fine scenery be dear to the heart of the British soldier, he ought to be happy at Newcastle. Nevertheless, I prefer the views from Raymond Lodge to any that Newcastle can afford.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Jamaica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Blue Mountain Peak,Blue Mountain Peak,18.04666,-76.57916,Anthony Trollope,1858,"However, I did go up the Blue Mountain Peak, which ascends—so I was told—to the respectable height of 8,000 feet above the sea level. To enable me to do this, I provided myself with a companion, and he provided me with five negroes, a supply of beef, bread, and water, some wine and brandy, and what appeared to me to be about ten gallons of rum; for we were to spend the night on the Blue Mountain Peak, in order that the rising sun might be rightly worshipped.
 
 For some considerable distance we rode, till we came indeed to the highest inhabited house in the island. This is the property of a coffee-planter who lives there, and who divides his time and energies between the growth of coffee and the entertainment of visitors to the mountain. So hospitable an old gentleman, or one so droll in speech, or singular in his mode of living, I shall probably never meet again. His tales as to the fate of other travellers made me tremble for what might some day be told of my own adventures. He feeds you gallantly, sends you on your way with a God-speed, and then hands you down to derision with the wickedest mockery. He is the gibing spirit of the mountain, and I would at any rate recommend no ladies to trust themselves to his courtesies.
 
 [...]
 
 I have nothing remarkable to tell of the ascent. We soon got into a cloud, and never got out of it. But that is a matter of course. We were soon wet through up to our middles, but that is a matter of course also. We came to various dreadful passages, which broke our toes and our nails and our hats, the worst of which was called Jacob's ladder—also a matter of course.

Cien Fuegos,Cienfuegos,22.15997,-80.44377,Anthony Trollope,1859,"[Trigger warnings]
 
 Cien Fuegos is a small new town on the southern coast of Cuba, created by the sugar trade, and devoted, of course, to commerce. It is clean, prosperous, and quickly increasing. Its streets are lighted with gas, while those in the Havana still depend upon oil-lamps. It has its opera, its governor's house, its alaméda, its military and public hospital, its market-place, and railway station; and unless the engineers deceive themselves, it will in time have its well. It has also that institution which in the eyes of travellers ranks so much above all others, a good and clean inn.
 
 My first object after landing was to see a slave sugar estate. I had been told in Jamaica that to effect this required some little management; that the owners of the slaves were not usually willing to allow strangers to see them at work; and that the manufacture of sugar in Cuba was as a rule kept sacred from profane eyes. But I found no such difficulty. I made my request to an English merchant at Cien Fuegos, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the proprietor of an estate some fifteen miles from the town; and by their joint courtesy I saw all that I wished.
 
 On this property, which consisted altogether of eighteen hundred acres—the greater portion of which was not yet under cultivation—there were six hundred acres of cane pieces. The average year's produce was eighteen hundred hogsheads, or three hogsheads to the acre. The hogshead was intended to represent a ton of sugar when it reached the market, but judging from all that I could learn it usually fell short of it by more than a hundredweight. The value of such a hogshead at Cien Fuegos was about twenty-five pounds. There were one hundred and fifty negro men on the estate, the average cash value of each man being three hundred and fifty pounds; most of the men had their wives. In stating this it must not be supposed that either I or my informant insist much on the validity of their marriage ceremony; any such ceremony was probably of rare occurrence. During the crop time, at which period my visit was made, and which lasts generally from November till May, the negroes sleep during six hours out of the twenty-four, have two for their meals, and work for sixteen! No difference is made on Sunday. Their food is very plentiful, and of a good and strong description. They are sleek and fat and large, like well-preserved brewers' horses; and with reference to them, as also with reference to the brewers' horses, it has probably been ascertained what amount of work may be exacted so as to give the greatest profit. During the remainder of the year the labour of the negroes averages twelve hours a day, and one day of rest in the week is usually allowed to them.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Cuba,"Caribbean, Latin Americ","Americas, North America"
Havana,Havana,23.11359,-82.36659,Anthony Trollope,1859,"There is nothing attractive about the town of Havana; nothing whatever to my mind, if we except the harbour. The streets are narrow, dirty, and foul. In this respect there is certainly much difference between those within and without the wall. The latter are wider, more airy, and less vile. But even in them there is nothing to justify the praises with which the Havana is generally mentioned in the West Indies. It excels in population, size, and no doubt in wealth any other city there; but this does not imply a great eulogium. The three principal public buildings are the Opera House, the Cathedral, and the palace of the Captain-General. The former has been nearly knocked down by an explosion of gas, and is now closed. I believe it to be an admirable model for a second-rate house. The cathedral is as devoid of beauty, both externally and internally, as such an edifice can be made. To describe such a building would be an absurd waste of time and patience. We all know what is a large Roman Catholic church, built in the worst taste, and by a combination of the lowest attributes of Gothic and Latin architecture. The palace, having been built for a residence, does not appear so utterly vile, though it is the child of some similar father. It occupies one side of a public square or pláza, and from its position has a moderately-imposing effect. Of pictures in the Havana there are none of which mention should be made.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Cuba,"Caribbean, Latin Americ","Americas, North America"
Paseo in Havana,"Paseo del Prado, Havana",23.1397,-82.35924,Anthony Trollope,1859,"But the glory of the Havana is the Paseo—the glory so called. This is the public drive and fashionable lounge of the town—the Hyde Park, the Bois de Boulogne, the Cascine, the Corso, the Alaméda. It is for their hour on the Paseo that the ladies dress themselves, and the gentlemen prepare their jewelry. It consists of a road running outside a portion of the wall, of the extent perhaps of half a mile, and ornamented with seats and avenues of trees, as are the boulevards at Paris. If it is to be compared with any other resort of the kind in the West Indies, it certainly must be owned there is nothing like it; but a European on first seeing it cannot understand why it is so eulogized. Indeed, it is probable that if he first goes thither alone, as was the case with me, he will pass over it, seeking for some other Paseo.
 
 But then the glory of the Paseo consists in its volantes. As one boasts that one has swum in a gondola, so will one boast of having sat in a volante. It is the pride of Cuban girls to appear on the Paseo in these carriages on the afternoons of holidays and Sundays; and there is certainly enough of the picturesque about the vehicle to make it worthy of some description. It is the most singular of carriages, and its construction is such as to give a flat contradiction to all an Englishman's preconceived notions respecting the power of horses.
 
 The volante is made to hold two sitters, though there is sometimes a low middle seat which affords accommodation to a third lady. We will commence the description from behind. There are two very huge wheels, rough, strong, high, thick, and of considerable weight. The axles generally are not capped, but the nave shines with coarse polished metal. Supported on the axletree, and swinging forward from it on springs, is the body of a cabriolet such as ordinary cabriolets used to be, with the seat, however, somewhat lower, and with much more room for the feet. The back of this is open, and generally a curtain hangs down over the open space. A metal bar, which is polished so as to look like silver, runs across the footboard and supports the feet. The body, it must be understood, swings forward from these high wheels, so that the whole of the weight, instead of being supported, hangs from it. Then there are a pair of shafts, which, counting from the back of the carriage to the front where they touch the horse at the saddle, are about fourteen feet in length. They do not go beyond the saddle, or the tug depending from the saddle in which they hang. From this immense length it comes to pass that there is a wide interval, exceeding six feet, between the carriage and the horse's tail; and it follows also, from the construction of the machine, that a large portion of the weight must rest on the horse's back.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Cuba,"Caribbean, Latin Americ","Americas, North America"
Harbour at Havana,Havana Harbor,23.13524,-82.34111,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The harbour at the Havana is an interesting sight. It is in the first place very picturesque, which to the ordinary visitor is the most important feature. But it is also commodious, large, and safe. It is approached between two forts. That to the westward, which is the principal defence, is called the Morro. Here also stands the lighthouse. No Englishman omits to hear, as he enters the harbour, that these forts were taken by the English in Albemarle's time. Now, it seems to me, they might very easily be taken by any one who chose to spend on them the necessary amount of gunpowder. But then I know nothing about forts.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Cuba,"Caribbean, Latin Americ","Americas, North America"
St. Kitts,St. Kitts,17.35782,-62.78299,Anthony Trollope,1859,"After leaving St. Thomas the first island seen of any note is St. Christopher, commonly known as St. Kitts, and Nevis is close to it. Both these colonies are prospering fairly. Sugar is exported, now I am told in increasing, though still not in great quantities, and the appearance of the cultivation is good. Looking up the side of the hills one sees the sugar-canes apparently in cleanly order, and they have an air of substantial comfort. Of course the times are not so bright as in the fine old days previous to emancipation; but nevertheless matters have been on the mend, and people are again beginning to get along. On the journey from Nevis to Antigua, Montserrat is sighted, and a singular island-rock called the Redonda is seen very plainly. Montserrat, I am told, is not prospering so well as St. Kitts or Nevis.
 
 These islands are not so beautiful, not so greenly beautiful, as are those further south to which we shall soon come. The mountains of Nevis are certainly fine as they are seen from the sea, but they are not, or do not seem to be covered with that delicious tropical growth which is so lovely in Jamaica and Trinidad, and, indeed, in many of the smaller islands.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Saint Kitts and Nevis,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Antigua,Antigua,17.06081,-61.79642,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Antigua is the next, going southward. This was, and perhaps is, an island of some importance. It is said to have been the first of the West Indian colonies which itself advocated the abolition of slavery, and to have been the only one which adopted complete emancipation at once, without any intermediate system of apprenticeship. Antigua has its own bishop, whose diocese includes also such of the Virgin Islands as belong to us, and the adjacent islands of St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat.
 
 Neither is Antigua remarkable for its beauty. It is approached, however, by an excellent and picturesque harbour, called English Harbour, which in former days was much used by the British navy; indeed, I believe it was at one time the head-quarters of a naval station. Premising, in the first place, that I know very little about harbours, I would say that nothing could be more secure than that. Whether or no it may be easy for sailing vessels to get in and out with certain winds, that, indeed, may be doubtful.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Antigua,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

And here we are among the rich green wild beauties of these thrice beautiful Caribbean islands. The mountain grouping of both these islands is very fine, and the hills are covered up to their summits with growth of the greenest. At both these islands one is struck with the great superiority of the French West Indian towns to those which belong to us. That in Guadaloupe is called Basseterre, and the capital of Martinique is St. Pierre. These towns offer remarkable contrasts to Roseau and Port Castries, the chief towns in the adjacent English islands of Dominica and St. Lucia. At the French ports one is landed at excellently contrived little piers, with proper apparatus for lighting, and well-kept steps. The quays are shaded by trees, the streets are neat and in good order, and the shops show that ordinary trade is thriving. There are water conduits with clear streams through the towns, and every thing is ship-shape. I must tell a very different tale when I come to speak of Dominica and St. Lucia.
 
 [...]
 
 Dominica and St. Lucia export annually about 6,000 hogsheads of sugar each. Martinique exports about 60,000 hogsheads. Martinique is certainly rather larger than either of the other two, but size has little or nothing to do with it. It is anything rather than want of fitting soil which makes the produce of sugar so inconsiderable in Dominica and St. Lucia.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Martinique,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
St. Pierre,St. Pierre,14.74166,-61.17583,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The reason for this is, I think, well given in a useful guide to the West Indies, published some years since, under the direction of the Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company. Speaking of St. Pierre, in Martinique, the author says: ""The streets are neat, regular, and cleanly. The houses are high, and have more the air of European houses than those of the English colonies. Some of the streets have an avenue of trees, which overshadow the footpath, and on either side are deep gutters, down which the water flows. There are five booksellers houses, and the fashions are well displayed in other shops. The French colonists, whether Creoles or French, consider the West Indies as their country. They cast no wistful looks towards France. They marry, educate, and build in and for the West Indies, and for the West Indies alone. In our colonies it is different. They are considered more as temporary lodging-places, to be deserted as soon as the occupiers have made money enough by molasses and sugar to return home.""","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Martinique,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

It fills one with an ardent desire to be off and rambling among those green mountains—as if one could ramble through such wild, bush country, or ramble at all with the thermometer at 85. But when one has only to think of such things without any idea of doing them, neither the bushes nor the thermometer are considered.
 
 One is landed at Dominica on a beach. If the water be quiet, one gets out dryshod by means of a strong jump; if the surf be high, one wades through it; if it be very high, one is of course upset. The same things happen at Jacmel, in Hayti; but then Englishmen look on the Haytians as an uncivilized, barbarous race. Seeing that Dominica lies just between Martinique and Guadaloupe, the difference between the English beach and surf and the French piers is the more remarkable.
 
 And then, the perils of the surf being passed, one walks into the town of Roseau. It is impossible to conceive a more distressing sight. Every house is in a state of decadence. There are no shops that can properly be so called; the people wander about chattering, idle and listless; the streets are covered with thick, rank grass; there is no sign either of money made or of money making. Everything seems to speak of desolation, apathy, and ruin. There is nothing, even in Jamaica, so sad to look at as the town of Roseau.
 
 The greater part of the population are French in manner, religion, and language, and one would be so glad to attribute to that fact this wretched look of apathetic poverty—if it were only possible. But we cannot do that after visiting Martinique and Guadaloupe. It might be said that a French people will not thrive under British rule. But if so, what of Trinidad? This look of misery has been attributed to a great fire which occurred some eighty years since; but when due industry has been at work great fires have usually produced improved towns. Now eighty years have afforded ample time for such improvement if it were forthcoming. Alas! it would seem that it is not forthcoming.
 
 It must, however, be stated in fairness that Dominica produces more coffee than sugar, and that the coffee estates have latterly been the most thriving. Singularly enough, her best customer has been the neighbouring French island of Martinique, in which some disease has latterly attacked the coffee plants.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Dominica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
St. Lucia,St. Lucia,13.90944,-60.97889,Anthony Trollope,1859,"We then reach St. Lucia, which is also very lovely as seen from the sea. This, too, is an island French in its language, manners, and religion; perhaps more entirely so than any other of the islands belonging to ourselves. The laws even are still French, and the people are, I believe, blessed (?) with no Lords and Commons. If I understand the matter rightly, St. Lucia is held as a colony or possession conquered from the French, and is governed, therefore, by a quasi-military governor, with the aid of a council. It is, however, in some measure dependent on the Governor of Barbados, who is again one of your supreme governors. There has, I believe, been some recent change which I do not pretend to understand. If these changes be not completed, and if it would not be presumptuous in me to offer a word of advice, I would say that in the present state of the island, with a Negro-Gallic population who do little or nothing, it might be as well to have as much as possible of the Queen, and as little as possible of the Lords and Commons.
 
 To the outward physical eye, St. Lucia is not so triste as Dominica. There is good landing there, and the little town of Castries, though anything but prosperous in itself, is prosperous in appearance as compared with Roseau.
 
 St. Lucia is peculiarly celebrated for its snakes. One cannot walk ten yards off the road—so one is told—without being bitten. And if one be bitten, death is certain—except by the interposition of a single individual of the island, who will cure the sufferer—for a consideration. Such, at least, is the report made on this matter. The first question one should ask on going there is as to the whereabouts and usual terms of that worthy and useful practitioner. There is, I believe, a great deal that is remarkable to attract the visitor among the mountains and valleys of St. Lucia.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Dominica,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Barbados,Barbados,13.19388,-59.54319,Anthony Trollope,1859,"And then in the usual course, running down the island, one goes to that British advanced post, Barbados—Barbados, that lies out to windward, guarding the other islands as it were! Barbados, that is and ever was entirely British! Barbados, that makes money, and is in all respects so respectable a little island! King George need not have feared at all; nor yet need Queen Victoria. If anything goes wrong in England—Napoleon coming there, not to kiss Her Majesty this time, but to make himself less agreeable—let Her Majesty come to Barbados, and she will be safe! I have said that Jamaica never boasts, and have on that account complained of her. Let such complaint be far from me when I speak of Barbados. But shall I not write a distinct chapter as to this most respectable little island—an island that pays its way?","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Barbados,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
St. Vincent,St. Vincent,13.25097,-61.18634,Anthony Trollope,1859,"St. Vincent is the next in our course, and this, too, is green and pretty, and tempting to look at. Here also the French have been in possession but comparatively for a short time. In settling this island, the chief difficulty the English had was with the old native Indians, who more than once endeavoured to turn out their British masters. The contest ended in their being effectually turned out by those British masters, who expelled them all bodily to the island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; where their descendants are now giving the Anglo-American diplomatists so much trouble in deciding whose subjects they truly are. May we not say that, having got rid of them out of St. Vincent, we can afford to get rid of them altogether?
 
 Kingston is the capital here. It looks much better than either Roseau or Castries, though by no means equal to Basseterre or St. Pierre.
 
 This island is said to be healthy, having in this respect a much better reputation than its neighbour St. Lucia, and as far as I could learn it is progressing—progressing slowly, but progressing—in spite even of the burden of Queens, Lords, and Commons. The Lords and Commons are no doubt considerably modified by official influence.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Grenadines,Grenadines,12.66666,-61.25,Anthony Trollope,1859,"And then the traveller runs down the Grenadines, a petty cluster of islands lying between St. Vincent and Grenada, of which Becquia and Cariacou are the chief. They have no direct connection with the mail steamers, but are, I believe, under the Governor of Barbados. They are very pretty, though not, as a rule, very productive. Of one of them I was told that the population were all females. What a Paradise of Houris, if it were but possible to find a good Mahommedan in these degenerate days!
 
 Grenada will be the last upon the list; for I did not visit or even see Tobago, and of Trinidad I have ventured to write a separate chapter, in spite of the shortness of my visit. Grenada is also very lovely, and is, I think, the head-quarters of the world for fruit. The finest mangoes I ever ate I found there; and I think the finest oranges and pine apples.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
St. Georges,St. Georges,12.05609,-61.74879,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The town of St. Georges, the capital, must at one time have been a place of considerable importance, and even now it has a very different appearance from those that I have just mentioned. It is more like a goodly English town than any other that I saw in any of the smaller British islands. It is well built, though built up and down steep hills, and contains large and comfortable houses. The market-place also looks like a market-place, and there are shops in it, in which trade is apparently carried on and money made.
 
 Indeed, Grenada was once a prince among these smaller islands, having other islands under it, with a Governor supreme, instead of tributary. It was fertile also, and productive—in every way of importance.
 
 But now here, as in so many other spots among the West Indies, we are driven to exclaim, Ichabod! The glory of our Grenada has departed, as has the glory of its great namesake in the old world. The houses, though so goodly, are but as so many Alhambras, whose tenants now are by no means great in the world's esteem.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Grenada,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
British Guiana,Guyana,4.86041,-58.93018,Anthony Trollope,1859,"When I settle out of England, and take to the colonies for good and all, British Guiana shall be the land of my adoption. If I call it Demerara perhaps I shall be better understood. At home there are prejudices against it I know. They say that it is a low, swampy, muddy strip of alluvial soil, infested with rattlesnakes, gallinippers, and musquitoes as big as turkey-cocks; that yellow fever rages there perennially; that the heat is unendurable; that society there is as stagnant as its waters; that men always die as soon as they reach it; and when they live are such wretched creatures that life is a misfortune. Calumny reports it to have been ruined by the abolition of slavery; milk of human kindness would forbid the further exportation of Europeans to this white man's grave; and philanthropy, for the good of mankind, would wish to have it drowned beneath its own rivers. There never was a land so ill spoken of—and never one that deserved it so little. All the above calumnies I contradict; and as I lived there for a fortnight—would it could have been a month!—I expect to be believed.
 
 [...]
 
 Guiana is an enormous extent of flat mud, the alluvial deposit of those mighty rivers which for so many years have been scraping together earth in those wild unknown upland countries, and bringing it down conveniently to the sea-board, so that the world might have sugar to its tea. I really think my friend was right. There is no limit to the fertility and extent of this region. The only limit is in labour. The present culture only skirts the sea-board and the riversides. You will hardly find an estate—I do not think that you can find one—that has not a water frontage. This land formerly belonged to the Dutch, and by them was divided out into portions which on a map have about them a Euclidical appearance. Let A B C D be a right-angled parallelogram, of which the sides A B and C D are three times the length of the other sides A C and B D. 'Tis thus you would describe a Demerara property, and the Q. E. D. would have reference to the relative quantities of sugar, molasses, and rum producible therefrom.
 
 But these strips of land, though they are thus marked out on the maps with four exact lines, are presumed to run back to any extent that the owner may choose to occupy. He starts from the water, and is bounded on each side; but backwards! Backwards he may cultivate canes up to the very Andes, if only he could get Coolies. Oh, ye soft-hearted, philanthropic gentry of the Anti-Slavery Society, only think of that; a million hogsheads of sugar—and you like cheap sugar yourselves—if you will only be quiet, or talk on subjects that you understand!
 
 The whole of this extent of mud, beyond the present very limited sugar-growing limits, is covered by timber. One is apt to think of an American forest as being as magnificent in its individual trees as it is huge in its extent of surface. But I doubt much whether this is generally the case. There are forest giants no doubt; but indigenous primeval wood is, I take it, for the most part a disagreeable, scrubby, bushy, sloppy, unequal, inconvenient sort of affair, to walk through which a man should be either an alligator or a monkey, and to make much way he should have a touch of both. There be no forest glades there in which uncivilized Indian lovers walk at ease, with their arms round each other's naked waists; no soft grass beneath the well-trimmed trunk on which to lie and meditate poetical. But musquitoes abound there; and grass flies, which locate themselves beneath the toe-nails; and marabunters, a villanous species of wasp; and gallinippers, the grandfathers of musquitoes; and from thence up to the xagua and the boa constrictor all nature is against a cool comfortable ramble in the woods.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Georgetown,Georgetown,6.80127,-58.15512,Anthony Trollope,1859,"If there be a deficiency in Georgetown—it is hardly necessary to explain that Georgetown is the capital of the province of Demerara, and that Demerara is the centre province in the colony of British Guiana; or that there are three provinces, Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo, so called from the names of the three great rivers of the country—But if there be a deficiency in Georgetown, it is in respect to cabs. The town is extensive, as will by-and-by be explained; and though I would not so far militate against the feelings of the people as to say that the weather is ever hot—I should be ungrateful as well as incredulous were I to do so—nevertheless, about noonday one's inclination for walking becomes subdued. Cabs would certainly be an addition to the luxuries of the place. But even these are not so essential as might at the first sight appear, for an invitation to dinner always includes an offer of the host's carriage. Without a carriage no one dreams of dragging on existence in British Guiana. In England one would as soon think of living in a house without a fireplace, or sleeping in a bed without a blanket.
 
 For those who wander abroad in quest of mountain scenery it must be admitted that this colony has not much attraction. The country certainly is flat. By this I mean to intimate, that go where you will, travel thereabouts as far as you may, the eye meets no rising ground. Everything stands on the same level. But then, what is the use of mountains? You can grow no sugar on them, even with ever so many Coolies. They are big, brown, valueless things, cumbering the face of the creation; very well for autumn idlers when they get to Switzerland, but utterly useless in a colony which has to count its prosperity by the number of its hogsheads. Jamaica has mountains, and look at Jamaica!
 
 [...]
 
 Georgetown to my eyes is a prepossessing city, flat as the country round it is, and deficient as it is—as are all the West Indies—in anything like architectural pretension. The streets are wide and airy. The houses, all built of wood, stand separately, each a little off the road; and though much has not been done in the way of their gardens—for till the great coming influx of Coolies all labour is engaged in making sugar—yet there is generally something green attached to each of them. Down the centre of every street runs a wide dyke. Of these dykes I must say something further when I come to speak again of the sugar doings; for their importance in these provinces cannot well be overrated.
 
 The houses themselves are generally without a hall. By that I mean that you walk directly into some sitting-room. This, indeed, is general through the West Indies; and now that I bethink me of the fact, I may mention that a friend of mine in Jamaica has no door whatsoever to his house. All ingress and egress is by the windows. My bedroom had no door, only a window that opened. The sitting-rooms in Georgetown open through to each other, so that the wind, let it come which way it will, may blow through the whole house. For though it is never absolutely hot in Guiana—as I have before mentioned—nevertheless, a current of air is comfortable. One soon learns to know the difference of windward and leeward when living in British Guiana.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Demerara,Demerara,5.77878,-58.38217,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Yes; Demerara is flat; and Berbice is flat; and so is Essequibo. The whole of this land is formed by the mud which has been brought down by these great rivers and by others. The Corentyne is the most easterly, separating our colony from Dutch Guiana, or Surinam. Then comes the Berbice. The next, counting only the larger rivers, is the Demerara. Then, more to the west, the Essequibo, and running into that the Mazarony and the Cuyuni; and then, north-west along the coast, the Pomeroon; and lastly of our own rivers, the Guiana, though I doubt whether for absolute purposes of colonization we have ever gone so far as this. And beyond that are rolled in slow but turbid volume the huge waters of the Orinoco. On its shores we make no claim. Though the delta of the Orinoco is still called Guiana, it belongs to the republic of Venezuela.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
"Georgetown, Demerara, to New Amsterdam, Berbice","Georgetown, Demerara, to New Amsterdam, Berbice",6.73677,-57.76265,Anthony Trollope,1859,"From Georgetown, Demerara, to New Amsterdam, Berbice, men travel either by steamer along the coast, or by a mail phaeton. The former goes once a week to Berbice and back, and the latter three times. I went by the mail phaeton and returned by the steamer. And here, considering the prosperity of the colony, the well-being and comfort of all men and women in it, the go-ahead principles of the place, and the coming million hogsheads of sugar—the millennium of a West Indian colony—considering all these great existing characteristics of Guiana, I must say that I think the Governor ought to look to the mail phaeton. It was a woful affair, crumbling to pieces along the road in the saddest manner; very heart-rending to the poor fellow who had to drive it, and body-rending to some of the five passengers who were tossed to and fro as every fresh fragment deserted the parent vehicle with a jerk. And then, when we had to send the axle to be mended, that staying in the road for two hours and a half among the musquitoes! Ohe! ohe! Ugh! ugh!
 
 It grieves me to mention this, seeing that rose colour was so clearly the prevailing tint in all matters belonging to Guiana. And I would have forgiven it had the phaeton simply broken down on the road. All sublunar phaetons are subject to such accidents. Why else should they have been named after him of the heavens who first suffered from such mishaps? But this phaeton had broken down before it commenced its journey. It started on a system of ropes, bandages, and patches which were disgraceful to such a colony and such a Governor; and I should intromit a clear duty, were I to allow it to escape the gibbet.
 
 But we did reach New Amsterdam not more than five hours after time. I have but very little to say of the road, except this: that there is ample scope for sugar and ample room for Coolies.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
New Amsterdam,New Amsterdam,6.24313,-57.51365,Anthony Trollope,1859,"[Trigger warnings]
 
 Late at night we did reach New Amsterdam, and crossed the broad Berbice after dark in a little ferryboat which seemed to be perilously near the water. At ten o'clock I found myself at the hotel, and pronounce it to be, without hesitation, the best inn, not only in that colony, but in any of these Western colonies belonging to Great Britain. It is kept by a negro, one Mr. Paris Brittain, of whom I was informed that he was once a slave. ""O, si sic omnes!"" But as regards my experience, he is merely the exception which proves the rule. I am glad, however, to say a good word for the energies and ambition of one of the race, and shall be glad if I can obtain for Mr. Paris Brittain an innkeeper's immortality.
 
 His deserts are so much the greater in that his scope for displaying them is so very limited. No man can walk along the broad strand street of New Amsterdam, and then up into its parallel street, so back towards the starting-point, and down again to the sea, without thinking of Knickerbocker and Rip van Winkle. The Dutchman who built New Amsterdam and made it once a thriving town must be still sleeping, as the New York Dutchman once slept, waiting the time when an irruption from Paramaribo and Surinam shall again restore the place to its old possessors.
 
 At present life certainly stagnates at New Amsterdam. Three persons in the street constitute a crowd, and five collected for any purpose would form a goodly club. But the place is clean and orderly, and the houses are good and in good repair. They stand, as do the houses in Georgetown, separately, each surrounded by its own garden or yard, and are built with reference to the wished-for breeze from the windows.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

The colony would have fair ground of complaint against me were I to omit to notice that it has so far progressed in civilization as to own a railway. As far as I could learn, the shares do not at present stand at a high premium. From Berbice I returned in a coasting steamer. It was a sleepy, dull, hot journey, without subject of deep interest. I can only remember of it that they gave us an excellent luncheon on board, and luncheons at such times are very valuable in breaking the tedium of the day.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Guyana,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Barbados,Barbados,13.19388,-59.54319,Anthony Trollope,1859,"[Trigger warnings.]
 
 Barbados is a very respectable little island, and it makes a great deal of sugar. It is not picturesquely beautiful, as are almost all the other Antilles, and therefore has but few attractions for strangers.
 
 But this very absence of scenic beauty has saved it from the fate of its neighbours. A country that is broken into landscapes, that boasts of its mountains, woods, and waterfalls, that is regarded for its wild loveliness, is seldom propitious to agriculture. A portion of the surface in all such regions defies the improving farmer. But, beyond this, such ground under the tropics offers every inducement to the negro squatter. In Jamaica, Dominica, St. Lucia, and Grenada, the negro, when emancipated, could squat and make himself happy; but in Barbados there was not an inch for him.
 
 [...]
 
 As to its appearance, it is, as I have said, totally different from any of the other islands, and to an English eye much less attractive in its character. But for the heat its appearance would not strike with any surprise an Englishman accustomed to an ordinary but ugly agricultural country. It has not the thick tropical foliage which is so abundant in the other islands, nor the wild, grassy dells. Happily for the Barbadians every inch of it will produce canes; and, to the credit of the Barbadians, every inch of it does so. A Barbadian has a right to be proud of this, but it does not make the island interesting. It is the waste land of the world that makes it picturesque. But there is not a rood of waste land in Barbados. It certainly is not the country for a gipsy immigration. Indeed, I doubt whether there is even room for a picnic.
 
 The island is something over twenty miles long, and something over twelve broad. The roads are excellent, but so white that they sadly hurt the eye of a stranger. The authorities have been very particular about their milestones, and the inhabitants talk much about their journeys. I found myself constantly being impressed with ideas of distance, till I was impelled to suggest a rather extended system of railroads—a proposition which was taken in very good part. I was informed that the population was larger than that of China, but my informant of course meant by the square foot. He could hardly have counted by the square mile in Barbados.
 
 And thus I was irresistibly made to think of the frog that would blow itself out and look as large as an ox.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Barbados,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Bridgetown,Barbados,13.10598,-59.61317,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Bridgetown, the metropolis of the island, is much like a second or third rate English town. It has none of the general peculiarities of the West Indies, except the heat. The streets are narrow, irregular, and crooked, so that at first a stranger is apt to miss his way. They all, however, converge at Trafalgar Square, a spot which, in Barbados, is presumed to compete with the open space at Charing Cross bearing the same name. They have this resemblance, that each contains a statue of Nelson. The Barbadian Trafalgar Square contains also a tree, which is more than can be said for its namesake. It can make also this boast, that no attempt has been made within it which has failed so grievously as our picture gallery. In saying this, however, I speak of the building only—by no means of the pictures.
 
 There are good shops in Bridgetown—good, respectable, well-to-do shops, that sell everything, from a candle down to a coffin, including wedding-rings, corals, and widows' caps. But they are hot, fusty, crowded places, as are such places in third-rate English towns. But then the question of heat here is of such vital moment! A purchase of a pair of gloves in Barbados drives one at once into the ice-house.
 
 And here it may be well to explain this very peculiar, delightful, but too dangerous West Indian institution. By-the-by, I do not know that there was any ice-house in Kingston, Jamaica. If there be one there, my friends were peculiarly backward, for I certainly was not made acquainted with it. But everywhere else—at Demerara, Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Thomas—I was duly introduced to the ice-house.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Barbados,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
Trinidad,Trinidad,10.6918,-61.2225,Anthony Trollope,1859,"No scenery can be more picturesque than that afforded by the entrance to Port of Spain, the chief town in the island of Trinidad. Trinidad, as all men doubtless know, is the southernmost of the West Indian islands, and lies across the delta of the Orinoco river. The western portion of the island is so placed that it nearly reaches with two horns two different parts of the mainland of Venezuela, one of the South American republics. And thus a bay is formed closed in between the island and the mainland, somewhat as is the Gulf of Mexico by the island of Cuba; only that the proportions here are much less in size. This enclosed sea is called the Gulf of Paria.
 
 [...]
 
 On the mainland, that is the land of the main island, the coast is precipitous, but clothed to the very top with the thickest and most magnificent foliage. With an opera-glass one can distinctly see the trees coming forth from the sides of the rocks as though no soil were necessary for them, and not even a shelf of stone needed for their support And these are not shrubs, but forest trees, with grand spreading branches, huge trunks, and brilliant coloured foliage. The small island on the other side is almost equally wooded, but is less precipitous. Here, however, there are open glades, and grassy enclosures, which tempt one to wish that it was one's lot to lie there in the green shade and eat bananas and mangoes. This little island in the good old days, regretted by not a few, when planters were planters, and slaves were slaves, produced cotton up to its very hill-tops. Now I believe it yields nothing but the grass for a few cattle.
 
 Our steamer as she got well into the boca drew near to the shore of the large island, and as we passed along we had a succession of lovely scenes. Soft-green smiling nooks made themselves visible below the rocks, the very spots for picnics. One could not but long to be there with straw hats and crinoline, pigeon pies and champagne baskets. There was one narrow shady valley, into which a creek of the sea ran up, that must have been made for such purposes, either for that, or for the less noisy joys of some Paul of Trinidad with his Creole Virginia.
 
 As we steamed on a little further we came to a whaling establishment. Ideas of whaling establishments naturally connect themselves with icebergs and the North Pole. But it seems that there are races of whales as there are of men, proper to the tropics as well as to the poles; and some of the former here render up their oily tributes. From the look of the place I should not say that the trade was flourishing. The whaling huts are very picturesque, but do not say much for the commercial enterprise of the proprietors.

 As my sojourn in Trinidad did not amount to two entire days, I do not feel myself qualified to give a detailed description of the whole island. Very few, I imagine, are so qualified, for much of it is unknown; there is a great want of roads, and a large proportion of it has, I believe, never been properly surveyed.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Trinidad and Tobago,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

 From them we went on through many smaller islands to Port of Spain. This is a large town, excellently well laid out, with the streets running all at right angles to each other, as is now so common in new towns. The spaces have been prepared for a much larger population than that now existing, so that it is at present straggling, unfilled, and full of gaps. But the time will come, and that before long, when it will be the best town in the British West Indies. There is at present in Port of Spain a degree of commercial enterprise quite unlike the sleepiness of Jamaica or the apathy of the smaller islands.
 
 [...]
 
 Immediately round Port of Spain the country is magnificent, and the views from the town itself are very lovely. Exactly behind the town, presuming the sea to be the front, is the Savanah, a large enclosed, park-like piece of common, the race-course and Hyde Park of Trinidad. I was told that the drive round it was three English miles in length; but if it be so much, the little pony which took me that drive in a hired buggy must have been a fast trotter.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Trinidad and Tobago,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

Here there are three passages, of which the middle is the largest one, the Boca Grande. That between the mainland and a small island is used by the steamers in fine weather, and is by far the prettiest. Through this, the Boca di Mona, or monkey's mouth, we approached Port of Spain. These northern entrances are called the Dragon's mouths.

When I was there the Governor's real house was being repaired, and the great man was living in a cottage hard by. Were I that great man I should be tempted to wish that my great house might always be under repair, for I never saw a more perfect specimen of a pretty spacious cottage, opening as a cottage should do on all sides and in every direction, with a great complexity as to doors and windows, and a delicious facility of losing one's way. And then the necessary freedom from boredom, etiquette, and Governor's grandeur, so hated by Governors themselves, which must necessarily be brought about by such a residence! I could almost wish to be a Governor myself, if I might be allowed to live in such a cottage.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Trinidad and Tobago,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"
St. Thomas,Saint Thomas,18.33809,-64.89409,Anthony Trollope,1859,"I have said in a previous chapter that the people one meets there may be described as an Hispano-Dano-Niggery-Yankee-doodle population. In this I referred not only to the settlers, but to those also who are constantly passing through it. In the shops and stores, and at the hotels, one meets the same mixture. The Spanish element is of course strong, for Venezuela, New Granada, Central America, and Mexico are all Spanish, as also is Cuba. The people of these lands speak Spanish, and hereabouts are called Spaniards. To the Danes the island belongs. The soldiers, officials, and custom-house people are Danes. They do not, however, mix much with their customers. They affect, I believe, to say that the island is overrun and destroyed by these strange comers, and that they would as lief be without such visitors. If they are altogether indifferent to money making, such may be the case. The labouring people are all black—if these blacks can be called a labouring people. They do coal the vessels at about a dollar a day each—that is, when they are so circumstanced as to require a dollar. As to the American element, that is by no means the slightest or most retiring. Dollars are going there, and therefore it is of course natural that Americans should be going also. I saw the other day a map, ""The United States as they now are, and in prospective;"" and it included all these places—Mexico, Central America, Cuba, St. Domingo, and even poor Jamaica. It may be that the man who made the map understood the destiny of his country; at any rate, he understood the tastes of his countrymen.
 
 [...]
 
 But we must give even the devil his due. Seen from the water St. Thomas is very pretty. It is not so much the scenery of the island that pleases as the aspect of the town itself. It stands on three hills or mounts, with higher hills, green to their summit, rising behind them. Each mount is topped by a pleasant, cleanly edifice, and pretty-looking houses stretch down the sides to the water's edge. The buildings do look pretty and nice, and as though chance had arranged them for a picture. Indeed, as seen from the harbour, the town looks like a panorama exquisitely painted. The air is thin and transparent, and every line shows itself clearly. As so seen the town of St. Thomas is certainly attractive. But it is like the Dead Sea fruit; all the charm is gone when it is tasted. Land there, and the beauty vanishes.
 
 [...]
 
 A hot climate, it is generally thought, interferes with the appetite, affects the gastric juices with lassitude, gives to the stomach some of the apathy of the body, and lessens at any rate the consumption of animal food. That charge cannot be made against the air of St. Thomas. To whatever sudden changes the health may be subject, no lingering disinclination for food affects it. Men eat there as though it were the only solace of their life, and women also. Probably it is so.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,U.S. Virgin Islands,Caribbean,"Americas, North America"

 The district of Columbia was one of the grandest appanages of the Spanish throne when the appanages of the Spanish throne were grand indeed. The town and port of Cartagena, on the Atlantic, were admirably fortified, as was also Panamá on the Pacific. Its interior cities were populous, flourishing, and, for that age, fairly civilized. Now the whole country has received the boon of Utopian freedom; and the mind loses itself in contemplating to what lowest pitch of human degradation the people will gradually fall.

Santa Martha,Santa Marta,11.24035,-74.21102,Anthony Trollope,1859,"This Santa Martha is a wretched village—a city it is there called—at which we, with intense cruelty, maintain a British Consul, and a British post-office. There is a cathedral there of the old Spanish order, with the choir removed from the altar down towards the western door; and there is, I was informed, a bishop. But neither bishop nor cathedral were in any way remarkable. There is there a governor of the province, some small tradesman, who seemed to exercise very few governing functions. It may almost be said that no trade exists in the place, which seemed indeed to be nearly dead.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Colombia,Latin America,"Americas, South America"
house in which Bolivar died,Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino,11.22825,-74.1774,Anthony Trollope,1859,"I rode some four or five miles into the country to visit the house in which Bolivar died. It is a deserted little country villa or chateau, called San Pedro, standing in a farm-yard, and now containing no other furniture than a marble bust of the Dictator, with a few wretchedly coloured French prints with cracked glass plates. The bust is not a bad one, and seems to have a solemn and sad meaning in its melancholy face, standing there in its solitary niche in the very room in which the would-be liberator died.
 
 For Bolivar had grand ideas of freedom, though doubtless he had grand ideas also of personal power and pre-eminence; as has been the case with most of those who have moved or professed to move in the vanguard of liberty. To free mankind from all injurious thraldom is the aspiration of such men; but who ever thought that obedience to himself was a thraldom that could be injurious?
 
 And here in this house, on the 17th December, 1830, Bolivar died, broken-hearted, owing his shelter to charity, and relieved in his last wants by the hands of strangers to his country. When the breath was out of him and he was well dead, so that on such a matter he himself could probably have no strong wish in any direction, they took away his body, of course with all honour, to the district that gave him birth, and that could afford to be proud of him now that he was dead;—into Venezuela and reburied him at Caracas. But dying poverty and funeral honours have been the fate of great men in other countries besides Columbia.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Colombia,Latin America,"Americas, South America"
Cartagena,Cartagena,10.39322,-75.48323,Anthony Trollope,1859,"I then went on to Cartagena. This is a much better town than Santa Martha, though even this is in its decadence. It was once a flourishing city, great in commerce and strong in war. It was taken by the English, not however without signal reverses on our part, and by the special valour—so the story goes—of certain sailors who dragged a single gun to the summit of a high abrupt hill called the ""Papa,"" which commands the town. If the thermometer stood in those days as high at Cartagena as it does now, pretty nearly through the whole of the year, those sailors ought to have had the Victoria cross. But these deeds were done long years ago, in the time of Drake and his followers; and Victoria crosses were then chiefly kept for the officers.
 
 The harbour at Cartagena is singularly circumstanced. There are two entrances to it, one some ten miles from the city and the other close to it. This nearer aperture was blocked up by the Spaniards, who sank ships across the mouth; and it has never been used or usable since. The present entrance is very strongly fortified. The fortifications are still there, bristling down to the water's edge; or they would bristle, were it not that all the guns have been sold for the value of the brass metal.
 
 Cartagena was hotter even than Santa Martha; but the place is by no means so desolate and death-like. The shops there are open to the streets, as shops are in other towns. Men and women may occasionally be seen about the square; and there is a trade,—in poultry if in nothing else.
 
 There is a cathedral here also, and I presume a bishop. The former is built after the Spanish fashion, and boasts a so-called handsome, large, marble pulpit. That it is large and marble, I confess; but I venture to question its claims to the other epithet. There are pictures also in the cathedral; of spirits in a state of torture certainly; and if I rightly remember of beatified spirits also. But in such pictures the agonies of the damned always excite more attention and a keener remembrance than the ecstasies of the blest. I cannot say that the artist had come up either to the spirit of Fra Angelico, or to the strength of Orcagna.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Colombia,Latin America,"Americas, South America"
Isthmus of Panamá,Isthmus of Panama,8.8855,-80.27673,Anthony Trollope,1859,"From Cartagena I went on to the isthmus; the Isthmus of Panamá, as it is called by all the world, though the American town of Aspinwall will gradually become the name best known in connexion with the passage between the two oceans.
 
 This passage is now made by a railway which has been opened by an American company between the town of Aspinwall, or Colon, as it is called in England, and the city of Panamá. Colon is the local name for this place, which also bears the denomination of Navy Bay in the language of sailors. But our friends from Yankee-land like to carry things with a high hand, and to have a nomenclature of their own. Here, as their energy and their money and their habits are undoubtedly in the ascendant, they will probably be successful; and the place will be called Aspinwall in spite of the disgust of the New Granadians, and the propriety of the English, who choose to adhere to the names of the existing government of the country.
 
 A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and Colon or Aspinwall will be equally vile however you may call it. It is a wretched, unhealthy, miserably situated but thriving little American town, created by and for the railway and the passenger traffic which comes here both from Southampton and New York. That from New York is of course immensely the greatest, for this is at present the main route to San Francisco and California.
 
 I visited the place three times, for I passed over the isthmus on my way to Costa Rica, and on my return from that country I went again to Panamá, and of course back to Colon. I can say nothing in its favour. My only dealing there was with a washerwoman, and I wish I could place before my readers a picture of my linen in the condition in which it came back from that artist's hands. I confess that I sat down and shed bitter tears. In these localities there are but two luxuries of life, iced soda-water and clean shirts. And now I was debarred from any true enjoyment of the latter for more than a fortnight.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Panamá,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Panamá,Panamá City,8.98237,-79.51986,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Panamá has doubtless become a place of importance to Englishmen and Americans, and its name is very familiar to our ears. But nevertheless it is a place whose glory has passed away. It was a large Spanish town, strongly fortified, with some thirty thousand inhabitants. Now its fortifications are mostly gone, its churches are tumbling to the ground, its old houses have so tumbled, and its old Spanish population has vanished. It is still the chief city of a State, and a congress sits there. There is a governor and a judge, and there are elections; but were it not for the passengers of the isthmus there would soon be but little left of the city of Panamá.
 
 [... racism ...]
 
 There is a Spanish cathedral here also, in which I heard a very sweet-toned organ, and one magnificent tenor voice. The old church buildings still standing here are not without pretence, and are interesting from the dark tawny colour of the stone, if from no other cause. I should guess them to be some two centuries old. Their style in many respects resembles that which is so generally odious to an Englishman's eye and ear, under the title of Renaissance. It is probably an offshoot of that which is called Plateresque in the south of Spain.
 
 During the whole time that I was at Panamá the thermometer stood at something above ninety. In Calcutta I believe it is often as high as one hundred and ten, so that I have no right to speak of the extreme heat. But, nevertheless, Panamá is supposed to be one of the hottest places in the western world; and I was assured, while there, that weather so continuously hot for the twenty-four hours had not been known during the last nine years. The rainy season should have commenced by this time—the early part of May. But it had not done so; and it appeared that when the rain is late, that is the hottest period of the whole year.
 
 The heat made me uncomfortable, but never made me ill. I lost all pleasure in eating, and indeed in everything else. I used to feel a craving for my food, but no appetite when it came. I was lethargic, as though from repletion, when I did eat, and was always glad when my watch would allow me to go to bed. But yet I was never ill.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Panamá,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Toboga,Toboga Island,8.78719,-79.55753,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Off from Panamá, a few miles distant in the western ocean, there are various picturesque islands. On two of these are the depôts of two great steam-packet companies, that belonging to the Americans which carries on the trade to California, and an English company whose vessels run down the Pacific to Peru and Chili. I visited Toboga, in which are the head-quarters of the latter. Here I found a small English maritime colony, with a little town of their own, composed of captains, doctors, engineers, officers, artificers, and sailors, living together on the company's wages, and as regards the upper classes, at tables provided by the company. But I saw there no women of any description. I beg therefore to suggest to the company that their servants would probably be much more comfortable if the institution partook less of the monastic order.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Panamá,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Punta-arenas—Sandy Point,Sandy Point,8.5609,-83.46435,Anthony Trollope,1859,"We steamed up the coast for two days quietly, placidly, and steadily. I cannot say that the trip was a pleasant one, remembering how intense was the heat. On one occasion we stopped for practice-shooting, and it behoved me of course to mount the paddle-box and see what was going on. This was at eleven in the morning, and though it did not last for above an hour, I was brought almost to fainting by the power of the sun.
 
 Punta-arenas—Sandy Point—is a small town and harbour situated in Costa Rica, near the top of the Bay of Nicoya, The sail up the bay is very pretty, through almost endless woods stretching away from the shores to the hills. There is, however, nothing majestic or grand about the scenery here. There are no Andes in sight, no stupendous mountains such as one might expect to see after coming so far to see them. It is all pretty quiet and ordinary; and on the whole perhaps superior to the views from the sea at Herne Bay.
 
 [...]
 
 It is a small village lying along a creek of the sea, inside the sandy point from whence it is named. Considerable business is done here in the exportation of coffee, which is the staple produce of Costa Rica. It is sent chiefly to England; but it seemed to me that the money-making inhabitants of Punta-arenas were mostly Americans; men who either had been to California or who had got so far on their road thither and then changed their minds. It is a hot, dusty, unattractive spot, with a Yankee inn, at which men may ""liquor,"" and a tram railroad running for twelve miles into the country. It abounds in oysters and beer, on which we dined before we started on our journey.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Costa Rica,Costa Rica,9.74891,-83.75342,Anthony Trollope,1859,"My visit was solely to Costa Rica, which has in some respects done better than its neighbours. But this has been owing to the circumstances of its soil and climate rather than to those of its government, which seems to me to be as bad as any can be which deserves that name. In Costa Rica there certainly is a government, and a very despotic one it is.
 
 [...]
 
 They told me that the soil in Costa Rica was very favourable to the sugar-cane, and I looked out to see some sugar among the coffee. But not a hogshead came that way. We saw patches of the cane growing by the roadside; but no more was produced than what sufficed for the use of the proprietor himself, and for such sale as the traffic on the road afforded. Indeed, I found that they do not make sugar, so called, in Costa Rica, but import what they use. The article fabricated is called by them ""dulce."" It comes from their hands in ugly round brown lumps, of the consistency of brick, looking, in truth, much more like a large brickbat than any possible saccharine arrangement. Nevertheless, the canes are fairly good, and the juice as sweet as that produced in first-rate sugar-growing soils.
 
 [...]
 
 Indeed, no climate can, I imagine, be more favourable to fertility and to man's comfort at the same time than that of the interior of Costa Rica. The sugar-cane comes to maturity much quicker than in Demerara or Cuba. There it should be cut in about thirteen or fourteen months from the time it is planted; in Nicaragua and Costa Rica it comes to perfection in nine or ten. The ground without manure will afford two crops of corn in a year. Coffee grows in great perfection, and gives a very heavy crop. The soil is all volcanic, or, I should perhaps more properly say, has been the produce of volcanoes, and is indescribably fertile. And all this has been given without that intensity of heat which in those southern regions generally accompanies tropical fertility, and which makes hard work fatal to a white man; while it creates lethargy and idleness, and neutralizes gifts which would otherwise be regarded as the fairest which God has bestowed on his creatures. In speaking thus, I refer to the central parts of Costa Rica only, to those which lie some thousand feet above the level of the sea. Along the sea-shores, both of the Atlantic and Pacific, the heat is as great, and the climate as unwholesome as in New Granada or the West Indies. It would be difficult to find a place worse circumstanced in this respect than Punta-arenas.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Road from Punta-arenas to San José,Road from Punta-arenas to San José,9.24774,-83.49648,Anthony Trollope,1859,"[Point very approximate.]
 
 Our road hitherto had been rising nearly the whole way, and had been generally through a picturesque country. We ascended one long severe hill, severe that is as a road, though to a professed climber of mountains it would be as nothing. From the summit of this hill we had a magnificent view down to the Pacific, Again, at a sort of fortress through which we passed, and which must have been first placed there by the old Spaniards to guard the hill-passes, we found a very lovely landscape looking down into the valley. Here some show of a demand was made for passports; but we had none to exhibit, and no opposition was made to our progress. Except at these two places, the scenery, which was always more or less, pretty, was never remarkable. And even at the two points named there was nothing to equal the mountain scenery of many countries in Europe.
 
 What struck me most was the constant traffic on the road or track over which we passed. I believe I may call it a road, for the produce of the country is brought down over it in bullock carts; and I think that in South Wales I have taken a gig over one very much of the same description. But it is extremely rude; and only fit for solid wooden wheels—circles, in fact, of timber—such as are used, and for the patient, slow step of the bullocks.
 
 But during the morning and evening hours the strings of these bullock carts were incessant. They travel from four till ten, then rest till three or four, and again proceed for four or five hours in the cool of the evening. They are all laden with coffee, and the idea they give is, that the growth of that article in Costa Rica must be much more than sufficient to supply the whole world. For miles and miles we met them, almost without any interval. Coffee, coffee, coffee; coffee, coffee, coffee! It is grown in large quantities, I believe, only in the high lands of San José; and all that is exported is sent down to Punta-arenas, though by travelling this route it must either pass across the isthmus railway at a vast cost, or else be carried round the Horn. At present half goes one way and half the other. But not a grain is carried, as it should all be carried, direct to the Atlantic. When I come to speak of the road from San José to Greytown, the reason for this will be understood.
 
 The bivouacs made on the roadside by the bullock drivers for their night and noon accommodation are very picturesque when seen filled by the animals. A piece of flat ground is selected by the roadside, about half an acre in size, and close to a river or some running water. Into this one or two hundred bullocks are taken, and then released from their carts. But they are kept yoked together to prevent their straying. Here they are fed exclusively on sugar-canes, which the men carry with them, and buy along the road. The drovers patiently cut the canes up with their knives, and the beasts patiently munch them. Neither the men nor the animals roar, as they would with us, or squabble for the use of the water-course, or curse their own ill luck or the good luck of their neighbours. Drivers and driven are alike orderly, patient, and slow, spending their lives in taking coffee down to Punta-arenas, and in cutting and munching thousands of sugar-canes.
 
 We passed some of those establishments by moonlight, and they looked like large crowded fairs full of low small booths. The men, however, do not put up tents, but sleep out in their carts.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"

That men should be found with their heads under their shoulders, or even living in holes burrowed in the ground, I had not ventured to hope. But when a man has travelled all the way to Costa Rica, he does expect something strange. He does not look to find everything as tame and flat and uninteresting as though he were riding into a sleepy little borough town in Wiltshire.
 
 [...]
 
 But there is little more interest to be found in entering San José than in driving through the little Wiltshire town above alluded to. The houses are comfortable enough. They are built with very ordinary doors and windows, of one or two stories according to the wealth of the owners, and are decently clean outside, though apparently rather dirty within. The streets are broad and straight, being all at right angles to each other, and though not very well paved, are not rough enough to elicit admiration. There is a square, the pláza, in which stands the cathedral, the barracks, and a few of the best houses in the town. There is a large and tolerably well-arranged market-place. There is a really handsome set of public buildings, and there are two moderately good hotels. What more can a man rationally want if he travel for business? And if he travel for pleasure how can he possibly find less?","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
valley of San José,Valle Central,9.91666,-84.06666,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The valley of San José, as it is called, is four thousand five hundred feet above the sea; and consequently, though within the tropics, and only ten degrees north of the line, the climate is good, and the heat, I believe, never excessive. I was there in April, and at that time, except for a few hours in the middle of the day, and that only on some days, there was nothing like tropical heat. Within ten days of my leaving San José I heard natives at Panamá complaining of the heat as being altogether unendurable. But up there, on that high plateau, the sun had no strength that was inconvenient even to an Englishman.
 
 [...]
 
 But though the valley or plateau of San José, and the interior of the country generally is thus favourably situated, I cannot say that the nation is prosperous. It seems to be God's will that highly-fertile countries should not really prosper. Man's energy is brought to its highest point by the presence of obstacles to be overcome, by the existence of difficulties which are all but insuperable. And therefore a Scotch farm will give a greater value in produce than an equal amount of land in Costa Rica. When nature does so much, man will do next to nothing!","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
cathedral of San José,The Metropolitan Cathedral of San José,9.93258,-84.07868,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The cathedral of San José is a long, low building, with side aisles formed by very rickety-looking wooden pillars—in substance they are hardly more than poles—running from the ground to the roof. The building itself is mean enough, but the internal decorations are not badly arranged, and the general appearance is neat, orderly, and cool. We all know the usual manner in which wooden and waxen virgins are dressed and ornamented in such churches. There is as much of this here as elsewhere; but I have seen it done in worse taste both in France and Italy. The façade of the church, fronting the pláza is hardly to be called a portion of the church; but is an adjunct to it, or rather the church has been fixed on to the façade, which is not without some architectural pretension.

 During the whole of Passion Week there was a considerable amount of religious activity, in the way of preaching and processions, which reached its acme on Good Friday. On that day the whole town was processioning from morning—which means four o'clock—till evening—which means two hours after sunset. They had three figures, or rather three characters,—for two of them appeared in more than one guise and form,—each larger than life; those, namely, of our Saviour, the Virgin, and St. John. These figures are made of wax, and the faces of some of them were excellently moulded. These are manufactured in Guatemala—as the priests are; and the people there pride themselves on their manufacture, not without reason.
 
 The figures of our Saviour and the Virgin were in different dresses and attitudes, according to the period of the day which it was intended to represent; but the St. John was always represented in the dress of a bishop of the present age. The figures were supported on men's shoulders, and were carried backwards and forwards through every portion of the town, till at last, having been brought forth in the morning from the cathedral, they were allowed at night to rest in a rival, and certainly better built, though smaller church.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"

I am told that it was built by a German, or rather by two Germans; the basement and the upper story being the work of different persons. Be this as it may, it is a handsome building, and would not disgrace any European capital. There is in it a throne-room—in England, at least, we should call it a throne; on this the President sits when he receives ambassadors from foreign countries. The velvet and gilding were quite unexceptionable, and the whole is very imposing. The sitting of Congress is held in the same chamber; but that, as I have explained, is not imposing.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"

There is one, the Monte Blanco, the summit of which has never yet been reached—so rumour says in Costa Rica—far distant, enveloped among other mountains, and to be reached only through dense aboriginal forests, which still emits, and is always emitting fire and burning floods of molten stones.
 
 Different excursions have been made with the object of ascending the Monte Blanco, but hitherto in vain. Not long since it was attempted by a French baron, but he and his guide were for twenty days in the woods, and then returned, their provisions failing them.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Cartago,Cartago,9.86223,-83.92141,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The way lay through a rich and finely-cultivated country. The whole of this is now called the valley of San José, and consists, in truth, of a broad plateau, diversified by moderate hills and valleys, but all being at a considerable height; that is, from three to four thousand feet above the sea. The road also is fairly good; so good that a species of omnibus runs on it daily, there being some considerable traffic between the places; for Cartago is the second town in the republic.
 
 Cartago is now the second town, but not long since it was the capital. It was, however, destroyed by an earthquake; and though it has been rebuilt, it has never again taken its former position. Its present population is said to be ten thousand; but this includes not only the suburbs, but the adjacent villages. The town covers a large tract of ground, which is divided into long, broad, parallel streets, with a large pláza in the middle; as though it had been expected that a fine Utopian city would have sprung up. Alas! there is nothing fine about it, and very little that is Utopian.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Crater of Mount Irazu,Cráter Principal del Volcán Irazú,9.98246,-83.84985,Anthony Trollope,1859,"The guide however now knew the spot. We were near the summit of Irazu, and a further ride of a quarter of an hour took us there; and indeed here there was no difficulty in riding. The side of the hill was covered with grass, and not over steep. ""There,"" said the mild voice, pointing to a broad, bushy, stumpy tree, ""there is the place where Lady Ouseley breakfasted."" And he looked at our modest havresack. ""And we will breakfast there too,"" I answered. ""But we will go down the crater first.""
 
 ""Oh, yes; certainly,"" said the mild voice. ""But perhaps—I don't know—I am not sure I can go exactly down into the crater.""
 
 The crater of the volcano is not at the top of the mountain, or rather it is not at what is now the top of the mountain; so that at first one has to look down upon it. I doubt even whether the volcano has ever effected the absolute summit. I may as well state here that the height of the mountain on which we were now standing is supposed to be 11,500 feet above the sea-level.
 
 Luckily for us, though the mist reached to us where we stood, everything to the left of us was clear, and we could look down, down into the crater as into a basin. Everything was clear, so that we could count the different orifices, eight in number, of which two, however, had almost run themselves into one; and see, as far as it was possible to see, how the present formation of the volcano had been brought about.
 
 It was as though a very large excavation had been made on the side of a hill, commencing, indeed, not quite from the summit, but very near it, and leaving a vast hole—not deep in proportion to its surface—sloping down the mountain-side. This huge excavation, which I take to be the extent of the crater, for it has evidently been all formed by the irruption of volcanic matter, is divided into two parts, a broken fragment of a mountain now lying between them; and the smaller of these two has lost all volcanic appearance. It is a good deal covered with bush and scrubby forest trees, and seems to have no remaining connection with sulphur and brimstone.
 
 The other part, in which the crater now absolutely in use is situated, is a large hollow in the mountain-side, which might perhaps contain a farm of six hundred acres. Not having been able to measure it, I know no other way of describing what appeared to me to be its size. But a great portion of this again has lost all its volcanic appendages; except, indeed, that lumps of lava are scattered over the whole of it, as they are, though more sparingly, over the mountain beyond. There is a ledge of rock running round the interior of this division of the excavation, half-way down it, like a row of seats in a Roman amphitheatre, or an excrescence, if one can fancy such, half-way down a teacup. The ground above this ledge is of course more extensive than that below, as the hollow narrows towards the bottom. The present working mouth of the volcanic, and all those that have been working for many a long year—the eight in number of which I have spoken—lie at the bottom of this lowest hollow. This I should say might contain a farm of about two hundred acres.

towns of Aredia and Barba,"Heredia, San José",9.99834,-84.12017,Anthony Trollope,1859,"[Location estimated.]
 
 We took four mules, that was one each for ourselves, and two for our baggage; we had two guides or muleteers, according to bargain, both of whom travelled on foot. The understanding was, that one mule lightly laden with provisions and a pair of slippers and tooth-brush should accompany us, one man also going with us; but that the heavy-laden mule should come along after us at its own pace. Things, however, did not so turn out: on the first day both the men and both the mules lagged behind, and on one occasion we were obliged to wait above an hour for them; but after that we all kept in a string together, having picked up a third muleteer somewhere on the road. We had also with us a distressed British subject, who was intrusted to my tender mercies by the Consul at San José. He was not a good sample of a Britisher; he had been a gold-finder in California, then a filibuster, after that a teacher of the piano in the country part of Costa Rica, and lastly an omnibus driver. He was to act as interpreter for us, which, however, he did not do with much honesty or zeal.
 
 Our road at first lay through the towns of Aredia and Barba, the former of which is a pleasant-looking little village, where, however, we found great difficulty in getting anything to drink. Up to this, and for a few leagues further, the road was very fair, and the land on each side of us was cultivated. We had started at eight a.m., and at about three in the afternoon there seemed to be great doubt as to where we should stop. The leading muleteer wished to take us to a house of a friend of his own, whereas the lieutenant and I resolved that the day's work had not been long enough. I take it that on the whole we were right, and the man gave in with sufficient good humour; but it ended in our passing the night in a miserable rancho. That at the potrero, on the road to the volcanic mountain, had been a palace to it.
 
 And here we got into the forest; we had hitherto been ascending the whole way from San José, and had by degrees lost all appearance of tillage. Still, however, there had been open spaces here and there cleared for cattle, and we had not as yet found ourselves absolutely enveloped by woods. This rancho was called Buena-vista; and certainly the view from it was very pretty. It was pretty and extensive, as I have seen views in Baden and parts of Bavaria; but again there was nothing about which I could rave.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Desenganos,Quebrada El Desengaño,10.19999,-84.16666,Anthony Trollope,1859,"On the next morning we again ascended for about a couple of leagues, and as long as we did so the road was still good; the surface was hard, and the track was broad, and a horseman could wish nothing better. And then we reached the summit of the ridge over which we were passing; this we did at a place called Desenganos, and from thence we looked down into vast valleys all running towards the Atlantic. Hitherto the fall of water had been into the Pacific.
 
 At this place we found a vast shed, with numberless bins and troughs lying under it in great confusion. The facts, as far as I could learn, were thus: Up to this point the government, that is Don Juan Mora, or perhaps his predecessor, had succeeded in making a road fit for the transit of mule carts. This shed had also been built to afford shelter for the postmen and accommodation for the muleteers. But here Don Juan's efforts had been stopped; money probably had failed; and the great remainder of the undertaking will, I fear, be left undone for many a long year.
 
 And yet this, or some other road from the valley of San José to the Atlantic, would be the natural outlet of the country. At present the coffee grown in the central high lands is carried down to Punta-arenas on the Pacific, although it must cross the Atlantic to reach its market; consequently, it is either taken round the Horn, and its sale thus delayed for months, or it is transported across the isthmus by railway, at an enormous cost. They say there is a point at which the Atlantic may be reached more easily than by the present route of the Serapiqui river; nothing, however, has as yet been done in the matter. To make a road fit even for mule carts, by the course of the present track, would certainly be a work of enormous difficulty.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Careblanco,Cariblanco,10.27318,-84.18241,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Splash, splash, slosh, slosh! we were at it all day. At Careblanco—the place of the white-faced pigs I understood it to mean;—they say that there is a race of wild hogs with white faces which inhabit the woods hereabouts—we overtook the post, and kept close to them afterwards. This was a pasture farm in the very middle of the forest, a bit of cleared land on which some adventurer had settled himself and dared to live. The adventurer himself was not there, but he had a very pretty wife, with whom my friend the lieutenant seemed to have contracted an intimate acquaintance on his previous journey up to San José.
 
 But at Careblanco we only stopped two minutes, during which, however, it became necessary that the lieutenant should go into the rancho on the matter of some article of clothes which had been left behind on his previous journey; and then, again, on we went, slosh, slosh, splash, splash! My shins by this time were black and blue, and I held myself on to my mule chiefly by my spurs. Our way was still through dense forest, and was always either up or down hill.
 
 And here we came across the grandest scenery that I met with in the western world; scenery which would admit of raving, if it were given to me to rave on such a subject.
 
 We were travelling for the most part along the side of a volcanic mountain, and every now and then the declivity would become so steep as to give us a full view down into the ravine below, with the prospect of the grand, steep, wooded hill on the other side, one huge forest stretching up the mountain for miles. At the bottom of the ravine one's eye would just catch a river, looking like a moving thread of silver wire. And yet, though the descent was so great, there would be no interruption to it. Looking down over the thick forest trees which grew almost from the side of a precipice, the eye would reach the river some thousand feet below, and then ascend on the other side over a like unbroken expanse of foliage.
 
 Of course we both declared that we had never seen anything to equal it. In moments of ecstasy one always does so declare. But there was a monotony about it, and a want of grouping which forbids me to place it on an equality with scenery really of the highest kind, with the mountains, for instance, round Colico, with the head of the Lake of the Four Cantons, or even with the views of the upper waters of Killarney.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"

At about five o'clock we splashed into another pasture farm in the middle of the forest, a place called San Miguel, and there we rested for that night. Here we found that our beef also must be thrown away, and that our bread was all gone. We had picked up some more hard-boiled eggs at ranchos on the road, but hard-boiled eggs to my companion were no more than grains of gravel to a barn-door fowl; they merely enabled him to enjoy his regular diet. At this place, however, we were able to purchase fowls—skinny old hens which were shot for us at a moment's warning. The price being, here and elsewhere along the road, a dollar a head. Tea and candles a ministering angel had given to me at the moment of my departure from San José. But for them we should have indeed been comfortless, thirsty, and in utter darkness.

This place is called the Muelle, and here there is a fort with a commandant and a small company of soldiers. The business of the commandant is to let no one up or down the river without a passport; and as a passport cannot be procured anywhere nearer than San José, here may arise a great difficulty to travellers. We were duly provided, but our recently-picked-up American friend was not; and he was simply told that he would not be allowed to get into a boat on the river.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Costa Rica,"CentralAmerica, Latin America","Americas, South America"
Serapiqui,Serapiqui,10.45154,-84.0067,Anthony Trollope,1859,"That passage down the Serapiqui was not without interest, though it was somewhat monotonous. Here, for the first time in my life, I found my bulk and size to be of advantage to me. In the after part of the canoe sat the master boatman, the captain of the expedition, steering with a paddle. Then came the mails and our luggage, and next to them I sat, having a seat to myself, being too weighty to share a bench with a neighbour. I therefore could lean back among the luggage; and with a cigar in my mouth, with a little wooden bicher of weak brandy and water beside me, I found that the position had its charms.
 
 [...]
 
 The Serapiqui is a fine river; very rapid, but not so much so as to make it dangerous, if care be taken to avoid the snags. There is not a house or hut on either side of it; but the forest comes down to the very brink. Up in the huge trees the monkeys hung jabbering, shaking their ugly heads at the boat as it went down, or screaming in anger at this invasion of their territories. The macaws flew high over head, making their own music, and then there was the constant little splash of the paddle in the water. The boatmen spoke no word, but worked on always, pausing now and again for a moment to drink out of the hollow of their hands. And the sun became hotter and hotter as we neared the sea; and the musquitoes began to bite; and cigars were lit with greater frequency.

Belly as the course for his impossible canal. It has seen dreadful scenes of cruelty, wrong, and bloodshed.

Greytown,Greytown,10.9462,-83.73452,Anthony Trollope,1859,"On the next morning we reached Greytown, following the San Juan river down to that pleasant place. There is another passage out to the sea by the Colorado, a branch river which, striking out from the San Juan, runs into the ocean by a shorter channel. This also has been thought of as a course for the projected canal, preferable to that of the San Juan. I believe them to be equally impracticable. The San Juan river itself is so shallow that we were frequently on the ground even in our light canoe.
 
 And what shall I say of Greytown? We have a Consul-General there, or at least had one when these pages were written; a Consul-General whose duty it is, or was, to have under his special care the King of Mosquitia—as some people are pleased to call this coast—of the Mosquito coast as it is generally styled. Bluefields, further along the coast, is the chosen residence of this sable tyrant; but Greytown is the capital of his dominions. Now it is believed that, in deference to the feelings of the United States, and to the American reading of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and in deference, I may add, to a very sensible consideration that the matter is of no possible moment to ourselves, the protectorate of the Mosquito coast is to be abandoned. What the king will do I cannot imagine; but it will be a happy day I should think for our Consul when he is removed from Greytown. Of all the places in which I have ever put my foot, I think that is the most wretched. It is a small town, perhaps of two thousand inhabitants, though this on my part is a mere guess, at the mouth of the San Juan, and surrounded on every side either by water or impassable forests. A walk of a mile in any direction would be impossible, unless along the beach of the sea; but this is of less importance, as the continual heat would prevent any one from thinking of such exercise. Sundry Americans live here, worshipping the almighty dollar as Americans do, keeping liquor shops and warehouses; and with the Americans, sundry Englishmen and sundry Germans. Of the female population I saw nothing except some negro women, and one white, or rather red-faced owner of a rum shop. The native population are the Mosquito Indians; but it seems that they are hardly allowed to live in Greytown. They are to be seen paddling about in their canoes, selling a few eggs and chickens, catching turtle, and not rarely getting drunk. They would seem from their colour and physiognomy to be a cross between the negro and the Indian; and such I imagine to be the case.

Looking back at my fortnight's sojourn there it seems to me that there can be no place in the world as to which there can be less to be said than there is about this island,—sayings at least of the sort in which it is my nature to express itself. Its geological formation is, I have no doubt, mysterious. It seems to be made of soft white stone, composed mostly of little shells; so soft, indeed, that you might cut Bermuda up with a handsaw. And people are cutting Bermuda up with handsaws. One little island, that on which the convicts are established, has been altogether so cut up already. When I visited it, two fat convicts were working away slowly at the last fragment.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Bermuda,Atlantic,"Atlantic, North America"
Hamilton,Hamilton,32.29456,-64.78538,Anthony Trollope,1859,"There are two towns, situated on different islands, called St. George and Hamilton. The former is the head-quarters of the military; the latter of the governor. In speaking of the place as a fortress I should have said that it is the summer head-quarters of the admiral in command of the Halifax station. The dock-yard, which is connected with the convict establishment, is at an island called Ireland; but the residence of the admiral is not far from Hamilton, on that which the Bermudians call the ""Continent.""
 
 I spent a week in each of these towns, and I can hardly say which I found the most triste. The island, or islands, as one must always say—using the plural number—have many gifts of nature to recommend them. They are extremely fertile. The land, with a very moderate amount of cultivation, will give two crops of ordinary potatoes, and one crop of sweet potatoes in the year. Most fruits will grow here, both those of the tropics and of the more northern latitudes. Oranges and lemons, peaches and strawberries, bananas and mulberries thrive, or would thrive equally well, if they were even slightly encouraged to do so.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Bermuda,Atlantic,"Atlantic, North America"
Bermuda,Bermuda,32.3078,-64.7505,Anthony Trollope,1859,"Snow is not prevalent in Bermuda, at least not in the months of May and June; but the first look of the houses in each of its two small towns, and indeed all over the island, gives one the idea of a snow storm. Every house is white, up from the ground to the very point of the roof. Nothing is in so great demand as whitewash. They whitewash their houses incessantly, and always include the roofs. This becomes a nuisance, from the glare it occasions; and is at last painful to the eyes. They say there that it is cleanly and cheap, and no one can deny that cleanliness and economy are important domestic virtues.
 
 [...]
 
 No climate in the world probably is better adapted for beetroot, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes. The place is so circumstanced geographically that it should be the early market-garden for New York—as to a certain small extent it is. New York cannot get her early potatoes—potatoes in May and June—from her own soil; but Bermuda can give them to her in any quantity.
 
 Arrowroot also grows here to perfection. The Bermudians claim to say that their arrowroot is the best in the world; and I believe that none bears a higher price. Then the land produces barley, oats, and Indian corn; and not only produces them, but produces two, sometimes three crops a year. Let the English farmer with his fallow field think of that.
 
 But with all their advantages Bermuda is very poor. Perhaps, I should add, that on the whole, she is contented with her poverty. And if so, why disturb such contentment?
 
 But, nevertheless, one cannot teach oneself not to be desirous of progress. One cannot but feel it sad to see people neglecting the good things which are under their feet. Lemons and oranges there are now none in Bermuda. The trees suffered a blight some year or two since, and no effort has been made to restore them. I saw no fruit of any description, though I am told I was there in the proper season, and heard much of the fruit that there used to be in former days. I saw no vegetables but potatoes and onions, and was told that as a rule the people are satisfied with them. I did not once encounter a piece of meat fit to be eaten, excepting when I dined on rations supplied by the Convict establishment. The poultry was somewhat better than the meat, but yet of a very poor description. Both bread and butter are bad; the latter quite uneatable. English people whom I met declared that they were unable to get anything to eat. The people, both white and black, seemed to be only half awake. The land is only half cultivated; and hardly half is tilled of that which might be tilled.
 
 The reason of this neglect, for I maintain that it is neglect, should however be explained. Nearly all the islands are covered with small stunted bushy cedar trees. Not cedars such as those of Lebanon, not the cedar trees of Central America, nor those to which we are accustomed in our gardens at home. In Bermuda they are, as I have said, low bushy trees, much resembling stunted firs. But the wood, when it can be found large enough, is, they say, good for shipbuilding; and as shipbuilding has for years been a trade in these islands, the old owners of the property do not like to clear their land.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Bermuda,Atlantic,"Atlantic, North America"
Bermudas,Bermudas,32.34156,-64.77927,Anthony Trollope,1859,"These islands are certainly very pretty; or I should perhaps say that the sea, which forms itself into bays and creeks by running in among them, is very pretty. The water is quite clear and transparent, there being little or no sand on those sides on which the ocean makes its entrance; and clear water is in itself so beautiful. Then the singular way in which the land is broken up into narrow necks, islands, and promontories, running here and there in a capricious, half-mysterious manner, creating a desire for amphibiosity, necessarily creates beauty. But it is mostly the beauty of the sea, and not of the land. The islands are flat, or at any rate there is no considerable elevation in them. They are covered throughout with those scrubby little trees; and, although the trees are green, and therefore when seen from the sea give a freshness to the landscape, they are uninteresting and monotonous on shore.
 
 I must not forget the oleanders, which at the time of my visit were in full flower; which, for aught I know, may be in full flower during the whole year. They are so general through all the islands, and the trees themselves are so covered with the large straggling, but bright blossoms, as to give quite a character to the scenery. The Bermudas might almost be called the oleander isles.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Bermuda,Atlantic,"Atlantic, North America"
Boaz (Island),Boaz Island,32.30824,-64.85332,Anthony Trollope,1859,"There is no wall round the prison. I must explain that the convicts are kept on two islands, those called Boaz and Ireland. At Boaz is the parent establishment, at which live the controller, chaplains, doctors, and head officers. But here is the lesser number of prisoners, about six hundred. They live in ordinary prisons. The other nine hundred are kept in two hulks, old men-of-war moored by the breakwaters, at the dockyard establishment in Ireland. It was in one of these that the murder was committed. The labour of these nine hundred men is devoted to the dockyard works. There is a bridge between the two islands over which runs a public road, and from this road there are ways equally public, as far as the eye goes, to all parts of the prison. A man has only to say that he is going to the chaplain's house, and he may pass all through the prison,—with spirits in his pocket if it so please him. That the prisoners should not be about without warders is no doubt a prison rule; but where everything is done by the prisoners, from the building of stores to the picking of weeds and lighting of lamps, how can any moderate number of warders see everything, even if they were inclined? There is nothing to prevent spirits being smuggled in after dark through the prison windows. And the men do get rum, and drunkenness is a common offence. Prisoners may work outside prison walls; but I remember no other prison that is not within walls—that looks from open windows on to open roads, as is here the case.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Bermuda,Atlantic,"Atlantic, North America"
Niagara,Niagara Falls,43.08955,-79.08494,Anthony Trollope,1859,"In that case let them not go on to what is called the Niagara Falls station, but pass over at a station called the Suspension Bridge—very well known on the road—to the other or Canada side of the water, and thence go to the Clifton Hotel. There can be no doubt as to this being the site at which tourists should stop. It is one of those cases in which to see is to be sure. But if the traveller be carried on to Niagara Falls station, he has a long and expensive journey to make back; and the United States side of the water will be antagonistic to him in doing so. The ticket from Albany to Niagara cost me six dollars; the carriage from Niagara to the Clifton Hotel cost me five. It was better to pay the five than to remain where I was; but it would have been better still to have saved them. I mention this as passengers to the Falls have no sort of intimation that they should get out at the Suspension Bridge; though they are all duly shaken out of their berths, and inquired of whether or not they be going west.
 
 Nothing ever disappointed me less than the Falls of Niagara—but my raptures did not truly commence for the first half-day. Their charms grow upon one like the conversation of a brilliant man. Their depth and breadth and altitude, their music, colour, and brilliancy are not fully acknowledged at the first moment. It may be that my eye is slow; but I can never take in to its full enjoyment any view or any picture at the first glance. I found this to be especially the case at Niagara. It was only by long gazing and long listening that I was able to appreciate the magnitude of that waste of waters.
 
 [...]
 
 But I must be allowed one word as to that visit after sunset; one word as to that which an obedient tourist will then see. In the spot to which I allude the visitor stands on a broad safe path, made of shingles, between the rock over which the water rushes and the rushing water. He will go in so far that the spray rising back from the bed of the torrent does not incommode him. With this exception, the further he can go the better; but here also circumstances will clearly show him the spot. Unless the water be driven in by a very strong wind, five yards make the difference between a comparatively dry coat and an absolutely wet one.
 
 And then let him stand with his back to the entrance, thus hiding the last glimmer of the expiring day. So standing he will look up among the falling waters, or down into the deep misty pit, from which they reascend in almost as palpable a bulk. The rock will be at his right hand, high and hard, and dark and straight, like the wall of some huge cavern, such as children enter in their dreams. For the first five minutes he will be looking but at the waters of a cataract,—at the waters, indeed, of such a cataract as we know no other, and at their interior curves, which elsewhere we cannot see. But by-and-by all this will change. He will no longer be on a shingly path beneath a waterfall; but that feeling of a cavern wall will grow upon him, of a cavern deep, deep below roaring seas, in which the waves are there, though they do not enter in upon him; or rather not the waves, but the very bowels of the deep ocean. He will feel as though the floods surrounded him, coming and going with their wild sounds, and he will hardly recognize that though among them he is not in them. And they, as they fall with a continual roar, not hurting the ear, but musical withal, will seem to move as the vast ocean waters may perhaps move in their internal currents. He will lose the sense of one continued descent, and think that they are passing round him in their appointed courses. The broken spray that rises from the depth below, rises so strongly, so palpably, so rapidly, that the motion in every direction will seem equal. And then, as he looks on, strange colours will show themselves through the mist; the shades of gray will become green and blue, with ever and anon a flash of white; and then, when some gust of wind blows in with greater violence, the sea-girt cavern will become all dark and black. Oh, my friend, let there be no one there to speak to thee then; no, not even a heart's brother. As you stand there speak only to the waters.","Anthony Trollope, The West Indies and the Spanish Main (London: Chapman & Hall, 1859), https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55100/55100-h/55100-h.htm,Canada,Great Lakes,"Americas, North America"

I was there late in June, but was very glad at that time to sit with my toes over a fire. The country about Saratoga is by no means pretty.

Tandjong Selor,Tanjung Selor,2.8448,117.3648,Carl Lumholtz,1913,"Two days later, among mighty forests of nipa-palms, we sailed up the Kayan or Bulungan River and arrived at Tandjong Selor, a small town populated by Malays and Chinese, the number of Europeans being usually limited to two, the controleur and the custom-house manager. It lies in a flat swampy country and on the opposite side of the river, which here is 600 metres wide, lives the Sultan of Bulungan.","Carl Lumholtz, Through Central Borneo; an Account of Two Years' Travel in the Land of Head-Hunters Between the Years 1913 and 1917 (NewYork: C.

Upper Mahakam,Mahakam River,2,113,Carl Lumholtz,1913,"On the Upper Mahakam I later made acquaintance with some of the Punans who roam the mountainous regions surrounding the headwaters of that river. Those are known under the name Punan Kohi, from a river of that name in the mountains toward Sarawak. The members of the same tribe further east in the mountains of the Bulungan district are called Punan Lun, from the River Lun, to whom the present individuals probably belonged. According to the raja, there are two kinds of Punans here, and his statement seems to be borne out by the variations in their physical appearance.","Carl Lumholtz, Through Central Borneo; an Account of Two Years' Travel in the Land of Head-Hunters Between the Years 1913 and 1917 (NewYork: C.

He estimated the number of inhabitants to be about 60,000, roughly speaking, 50 to each mile, but the population here as elsewhere follows the rivers.

Vienna,Vienna,48.2082,16.3738,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"And thus, on the 22d of March 1842, I commenced my journey from Vienna.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Galatz,Galatz,45.4353,28.008,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"The scenery round the town is so far from being inviting, that I did not feel the least inclination to explore it.  I therefore remained in the town, and went up hill and down dale through the ill-paved streets.  Coffee-houses appear in great abundance; but if it were not for the people sitting in front of them drinking coffee and smoking tobacco, no one would do these dirty rooms the honour of taking them for places of entertainment.

In the market and the squares we notice a great preponderance of the male sex over the female.  The former are seen bustling about every where, and, like the Italians, perform some duties which usually fall to the lot of the softer sex.  We notice a mixture of the most different nations, and among them a particularly large number of Jews.

The bazaar is overloaded with southern fruits of all kinds.  Oranges and lemons are seen here in great numbers, like the commonest of our fruits.  The prices are of course very trifling.  The cauliflowers brought from Asia Minor are particularly fine.  I noticed many as large as a man’s head.

In the evening I was required to repair to the harbour and re-embark.

It is almost impossible to form an idea of the confusion which reigns here.  A wooden railing forms the barrier between the healthy people and those who come from or intend travelling to a country infected with the plague.  Whoever passes this line of demarcation is not allowed to return.  Soldiers, officers, government officials, and superintendents, the latter of whom are armed with sticks and pairs of tongs, stand at the entrance to drive those forcibly back who will not be content with fair words.  Provisions and other articles are either thrown over the barrier or left in front of it.  In the latter case, however, they may not be touched until the bearers have departed.  A gentleman on the “plague” side wished to give a letter to one on the other; it was immediately snatched from his hand and handed across by means of a pair of tongs.  And all this time such a noise and hubbub is going on, that you can scarcely hear the sound of your own voice.

“Pray hand me over my luggage!” cries one.  “Keep farther away! don’t come near me, and mind you don’t touch me!” anxiously exclaims another.  And then the superintendents keep shouting—“Stand back, stand back!” etc.

I was highly entertained by this spectacle; the scene was entirely new to me.  But on my return, when I shall be one of the prisoners, I fear I may find it rather tedious.  For this time I was not at all hindered in the prosecution of my journey.

On the whole, these timid precautions seemed to me exceedingly uncalled for, particularly at a time when neither the plague nor any kind of contagious disease prevailed in Turkey.  One of my fellow-passengers had been banished to our ship on the previous day because he had had the misfortune to brush against an official on going to see after his luggage.

At seven o’clock the tattoo is beaten, the grating is shut, and the farce ends.  We now repaired to the fourth and last steamer, the Ferdinand.  From first to last we changed vessels six times during a journey from Vienna to Constantinople; we travelled by four steamers and twice in boats; a circumstance which cannot be reckoned among the pleasures of a trip down the Danube.

Though not a large boat, the Ferdinand is comfortable and well built.  Even the second-class cabin is neatly arranged, and a pretty stove diffused a warmth which was peculiarly grateful to us all, as the thermometer showed only six to eight degrees above zero.  Unfortunately even here the men and women are not separated in the second-class cabin; but care is at least taken that third-class passengers do not intrude.  Twelve berths are arranged round the walls, and in front of these are placed broad benches well cushioned.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Constantinople,Istanbul,41.0082,28.9784,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"I arrived at Constantinople on a Tuesday, and immediately inquired what was worth seeing.  I was advised to go and see the dancing dervishes, as this was the day on which they held their religious exercises in Pera.

As I reached the mosque an hour too soon, I betook myself in the meantime to the adjoining garden, which is set apart as the place of meeting of the Turkish women.  Here several hundred ladies reclined on the grass in varied groups, surrounded by their children and their nurses, the latter of whom are all negresses.  Many of these Turkish women were smoking pipes of tobacco with an appearance of extreme enjoyment, and drinking small cups of coffee without milk.  Two or three friends often made use of the same pipe, which was passed round from mouth to mouth.  These ladies seemed also to be partial to dainties: most of them were well provided with raisins, figs, sugared nuts, cakes, etc., and ate as much as the little ones.  They seemed to treat their slaves very kindly; the black servants sat among their mistresses, and munched away bravely: the slaves are well dressed, and could scarcely be distinguished from their owners, were it not for their sable hue.

During my whole journey I remarked with pleasure that the lot of a slave in the house of a Mussulman is not nearly so hard as we believe.  The Turkish women are no great admirers of animated conversations; still there was more talking in their societies than in the assemblies of the men, who sit silent and half asleep in the coffee-houses, languidly listening to the narrations of a story-teller.

The ladies’ garden resembles a churchyard.  Funeral monuments peer forth at intervals between the cypresses, beneath which the visitors sit talking and joking cheerfully.  Every now and then one would suddenly start up, spread a carpet beside her companions, and kneel down to perform her devotions.

As no one of the male sex was allowed to be present, all were unveiled.  I noticed many pretty faces among them, but not a single instance of rare or striking beauty.  Fancy large brilliant eyes, pale cheeks, broad faces, and an occasional tendency to corpulence, and you have the ladies’ portrait.  Small-pox must still be rather prevalent in these parts, for I saw marks of it on many faces.

The Turkish ladies’ costume is not very tasteful.  When they go abroad, they are completely swathed in an upper garment, generally made of dark merino.  In the harem, or in any place where men are not admitted, they doff this garment, and also the white cloth in which they wrap their heads and faces.  Their costume consists, properly speaking, of very wide trousers drawn together below the ancle, a petticoat with large wide sleeves, and a broad sash round the waist.  Over this sash some wear a caftan, others only a spencer, generally of silk.  On their feet they wear delicate boots, and over these slippers of yellow morocco; on their heads a small fez-cap, from beneath which their hair falls on their shoulders in a number of thin plaits.  Those Turks, male and female, who are descended from Mahomet, have either a green caftan or a green turban.  This colour is here held so sacred, that scarcely any one may wear it.  I would even advise the Franks to avoid green in their dresses, as they may expose themselves to annoyance by using it.

After I had had more than an hour’s leisure to notice all these circumstances, a noise suddenly arose in the courtyard, which produced a stir among the women.  I considered from these appearances that it was time to go to the temple, and hastened to join my party.  A great crowd was waiting in the courtyard, for the Sultan was expected.  I was glad to have the good fortune to behold him on the very day of my arrival.  As a stranger, I was allowed, without opposition, a place in the front ranks,—a trait of good breeding on the part of the Turks which many a Frank would do well to imitate.  In a Turk, moreover, this politeness is doubly praiseworthy, from the fact that he looks upon my poor sex with great disrespect; indeed, according to his creed, we have not even a soul.

I had only stood a few moments, when the Sultan appeared on horseback, surrounded by his train.  He alone rode into the courtyard; the others all dismounted at the gate, and entered on foot.  The horse on which the Sultan rode was of rare beauty, and, as they told me, of the true Arabian breed; the saddle-cloth was richly embroidered with gold, and the stirrups, of the same precious metal, were in the form of shoes, covered with the finest chased work.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Scutari,Uskudar,41.0189,29.0576,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"I chose a Friday for an excursion to Scutari, the celebrated burying-place of the Turks, in order that I might have an opportunity of seeing the “howling dervishes.”

In company with a French physician, I traversed the Bosphorus in a kaik. {48}  We passed by the “Leander’s Tower,” which stands in the sea, a few hundred paces from the Asiatic coast, and has been so frequently celebrated in song by the poets.  We soon arrived at our destination.

It was with a peculiar feeling of emotion that for the first time in my life I set foot on a new quarter of the globe.  Now, and not till now, I seemed separated by an immeasurable distance from my home.  Afterwards, when I landed on the coast of Africa, the circumstance did not produce the same impression on my mind.

Now at length I was standing in the quarter of the earth which had been the cradle of the human race; where man had risen high, and had again sunk so low that the Almighty had almost annihilated him in his righteous anger.  And here in Asia it was that the Son of God came on earth to bring the boon of redemption to fallen man.  My long and warmly-cherished wish to tread this most wonderful of the four quarters of the earth was at length fulfilled, and with God’s help I might confidently hope to reach the sacred region whence the true light of the world had shone forth.

Burial Place at Scutari.

Scutari is the place towards which the Mussulman looks with the hope of one day reposing beneath its shade.  No disciple of any other creed is allowed to be buried here; and here, therefore, the Mahometan feels himself at home, and worthy of his Prophet.  The cemetery is the grandest in the world.  One may wander for hours through this grove of cypresses, without reaching the end.  On the gravestones of the men turbans are sculptured; on those of the women fruits and flowers: the execution is in most cases very indifferent.

Though neither the chief nor the tributary streets in Scutari are even, they are neither so badly paved nor quite so narrow as those at Pera.  The great barracks, on a height in the foreground, present a splendid appearance, and also afford a delicious view towards the Sea of Marmora and the inimitably beautiful Bosphorus.  The barracks are said to contain accommodation for 10,000 men.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Caesarea,Caesarea,32.519,34.9045,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"During the night we reached Cæsarea.  With the eloquence of a Demosthenes, our captain endeavoured to dissuade us from our project of landing here; he pointed out to us the dangers to which we were exposing ourselves, and the risks we should run from Bedouins and snakes.  The former, he averred, were accustomed to conceal themselves in hordes among the ruins, in order to ease travellers of their effects and money; being well aware that such spots were only visited by curious tourists with well-filled purses, they were continually on the watch, like the robber-knights of the good old German empire.  “An enemy no less formidable,” said the captain, “was to be encountered in the persons of numerous snakes lurking in the old walls and on the weed-covered ground, which endangered the life of the traveller at every step.”  We were perfectly well aware of these facts, having gleaned them partly from descriptions of voyages, partly from oral traditions; and so they were not powerful enough to arrest our curiosity.  The captain himself was really less actuated by the sense of our danger, in advising us to abandon our undertaking, than by the reflection of the time it lost him; but he exerted himself in vain.  He was obliged to cast anchor, and at daybreak to send a boat ashore with us.

Our arms consisted of parasols and sticks (the latter we carried in order to beat the bushes); we were escorted by the captain, his servant, and a couple of sailors.

In the ruins we certainly met with a few suspicious-looking characters in the shape of wandering Bedouins.  As it was too late to beat a retreat, we advanced bravely towards them with trusting and friendly looks.  The Bedouins did the same, and so there was an end of this dangerous affair.  We climbed from one fragment to another, and certainly spent more than two hours among the ruins, without sustaining the slightest injury at the hands of these people.  Of the threatened snakes we saw not a single one.

Ruins, indeed, we found every where in plenty.  Whole side-walls, which appeared to have belonged to private houses, but not to splendid palaces or temples, stood erect and almost unscathed.  Fragments of pillars lay scattered about in great abundance, but without capitals, pedestals, or friezes.

It was with a feeling of awe hitherto unknown to me that I trod the ground where my Redeemer had walked.  Every spot, every building became invested with a double interest.  “Perchance,” I thought, “I may be lingering within the very house where Jesus once sojourned.”  More than satisfied with my excursion, I returned to our bark.

By three o’clock in the afternoon we were close under the walls of Joppa.  To enter this harbour, partially choked up as it is with sand, is described as a difficult feat.  We were assured that we should see many wrecks of stranded ships and boats; accordingly I strained my eyes to the utmost, and could discover nothing.  We ran safely in; and thus ended a little journey in the course of which I had seen many new and interesting objects, besides gaining some insight into the mode of life among the sailors.  Frequently, when it fell calm, our Arabs would recline on the ground in a circle, singing songs of an inconceivably inharmonious and lugubrious character, while they clapped their hands in cadence, and burst at intervals into a barking laugh.  I could not find any thing very amusing in this entertainment; on the contrary, it had the effect of making me feel very melancholy, as displaying these good people in a very idiotic and degrading light.

The costume of the sailors was simple in the extreme.  A shirt covered them in rather an imperfect manner, and a handkerchief bound round their heads protected them from a coup de soleil.  The captain was distinguished from the rest only by his turban, which looked ridiculous enough, surmounting his half-clad form.  Their diet consisted of a single warm meal of pilau or beans, eaten in the evening.  During the day they stayed their appetites with bread.  Their drink was water.

The town of Joppa, extending from the sea-shore to the summit of a rather considerable and completely isolated hill, has a most peculiar appearance.  The lower street is surrounded by a wall, and appears sufficiently broad; the remaining streets run up the face of the hills, and seem at a distance to be resting on the houses below.  Viewing the town from our boat, I could have sworn that people were walking about on flat house-tops.

As Joppa boasts neither an inn nor a convent which might shelter a traveller, I waited upon the Consul of the Austrian Empire, Herr D---, who received me very kindly and introduced me to his family, which comprised his lady, three sons, and three daughters.  They wore the Turkish costume.  The daughters, two of whom were exceedingly beautiful, wore wide trousers, a caftan, and a sash round the waist.  On their heads they had little fez-caps, and their hair was divided into fifteen or twenty narrow plaits, interwoven with little gold coins, and a larger one at the end of each plait.  A necklace of gold coins encircled their necks.  The mother was dressed in exactly the same way.  When elderly women have little or no hair left, they make up with artificial silk plaits for the deficiencies of nature.

The custom of wearing coins as ornaments is so prevalent throughout Syria, that the very poorest women, girls, and children strive to display as many as possible.  Where they cannot sport gold, they content themselves with silver money; and where even this metal is not attainable, with little coins of copper and other baser metals.

The Consul and his son were also clothed in the Turkish garb; but instead of a turban the father wore an old cocked hat, which gave him an indescribably ludicrous appearance.  A son and a daughter of this worthy patron of the semi-Turkish, semi-European garb, had but one eye, a defect frequently met with in Syria.  It is generally supposed to be caused by the dry heat, the fine particles of sand, and the intense glare of the chalky hills.

As I reached Joppa early in the afternoon, I proceeded in company of the Consul to view the town and its environs.  In dirt, bad paving, etc., I found it equal to any of the towns I had yet seen.  The lower street, near the sea, alone is broad and bustling, with loaded and unloaded camels passing continually to and fro.  The bazaar is composed of some miserable booths containing common provisions and a few cheap wares.

The neighbourhood of Joppa is exceedingly fertile.  Numerous large gardens, with trees laden with all kinds of tropical fruits, and guarded by impenetrable hedges of the Indian fig-tree, form a half-circle round the lower portion of the town.

The Indian fig-tree, which I here saw for the first time, has an odd appearance.  From its stem, which is very dwarfish, leaves a foot in length, six inches in breadth, and half an inch in thickness, shoot forth.  This tree seldom sends forth branches; the leaves grow one out of another, and at the extremity the fruit is formed.  Its length is about two or three inches.  Ten or twenty such figs are frequently found adhering to a single leaf.

I could not conceive how it happened that in these hot countries, without rain to refresh them, the trees all looked so healthy and beautiful.  This fact, I found, was owing to the numerous channels cut through the gardens, which are thus artificially irrigated.  The heavy dews and cool nights also tend to restore the drooping vegetation.  One great ornament of our gardens was, however, totally wanting—a lawn with wild flowers.  Trees and vegetables here grow out of the sandy or stony earth, a circumstance hardly noticed at a distance, but which produces a disagreeable effect on a near view.  Flowers I found none.

Frequently, when it fell calm, our Arabs would recline on the ground in a circle, singing songs of an inconceivably inharmonious and lugubrious character, while they clapped their hands in cadence, and burst at intervals into a barking laugh.  I could not find any thing very amusing in this entertainment; on the contrary, it had the effect of making me feel very melancholy, as displaying these good people in a very idiotic and degrading light.

The costume of the sailors was simple in the extreme.  A shirt covered them in rather an imperfect manner, and a handkerchief bound round their heads protected them from a coup de soleil.  The captain was distinguished from the rest only by his turban, which looked ridiculous enough, surmounting his half-clad form.  Their diet consisted of a single warm meal of pilau or beans, eaten in the evening.  During the day they stayed their appetites with bread.  Their drink was water.

The town of Joppa, extending from the sea-shore to the summit of a rather considerable and completely isolated hill, has a most peculiar appearance.  The lower street is surrounded by a wall, and appears sufficiently broad; the remaining streets run up the face of the hills, and seem at a distance to be resting on the houses below.  Viewing the town from our boat, I could have sworn that people were walking about on flat house-tops.

As Joppa boasts neither an inn nor a convent which might shelter a traveller, I waited upon the Consul of the Austrian Empire, Herr D---, who received me very kindly and introduced me to his family, which comprised his lady, three sons, and three daughters.  They wore the Turkish costume.  The daughters, two of whom were exceedingly beautiful, wore wide trousers, a caftan, and a sash round the waist.  On their heads they had little fez-caps, and their hair was divided into fifteen or twenty narrow plaits, interwoven with little gold coins, and a larger one at the end of each plait.  A necklace of gold coins encircled their necks.  The mother was dressed in exactly the same way.  When elderly women have little or no hair left, they make up with artificial silk plaits for the deficiencies of nature.

The custom of wearing coins as ornaments is so prevalent throughout Syria, that the very poorest women, girls, and children strive to display as many as possible.  Where they cannot sport gold, they content themselves with silver money; and where even this metal is not attainable, with little coins of copper and other baser metals.

The Consul and his son were also clothed in the Turkish garb; but instead of a turban the father wore an old cocked hat, which gave him an indescribably ludicrous appearance.  A son and a daughter of this worthy patron of the semi-Turkish, semi-European garb, had but one eye, a defect frequently met with in Syria.  It is generally supposed to be caused by the dry heat, the fine particles of sand, and the intense glare of the chalky hills.

As I reached Joppa early in the afternoon, I proceeded in company of the Consul to view the town and its environs.  In dirt, bad paving, etc., I found it equal to any of the towns I had yet seen.  The lower street, near the sea, alone is broad and bustling, with loaded and unloaded camels passing continually to and fro.  The bazaar is composed of some miserable booths containing common provisions and a few cheap wares.

The neighbourhood of Joppa is exceedingly fertile.  Numerous large gardens, with trees laden with all kinds of tropical fruits, and guarded by impenetrable hedges of the Indian fig-tree, form a half-circle round the lower portion of the town.

The Indian fig-tree, which I here saw for the first time, has an odd appearance.  From its stem, which is very dwarfish, leaves a foot in length, six inches in breadth, and half an inch in thickness, shoot forth.  This tree seldom sends forth branches; the leaves grow one out of another, and at the extremity the fruit is formed.  Its length is about two or three inches.  Ten or twenty such figs are frequently found adhering to a single leaf.

I could not conceive how it happened that in these hot countries, without rain to refresh them, the trees all looked so healthy and beautiful.  This fact, I found, was owing to the numerous channels cut through the gardens, which are thus artificially irrigated.  The heavy dews and cool nights also tend to restore the drooping vegetation.  One great ornament of our gardens was, however, totally wanting—a lawn with wild flowers.  Trees and vegetables here grow out of the sandy or stony earth, a circumstance hardly noticed at a distance, but which produces a disagreeable effect on a near view.  Flowers I found none.
During the night we reached Cæsarea.  With the eloquence of a Demosthenes, our captain endeavoured to dissuade us from our project of landing here; he pointed out to us the dangers to which we were exposing ourselves, and the risks we should run from Bedouins and snakes.  The former, he averred, were accustomed to conceal themselves in hordes among the ruins, in order to ease travellers of their effects and money; being well aware that such spots were only visited by curious tourists with well-filled purses, they were continually on the watch, like the robber-knights of the good old German empire.  “An enemy no less formidable,” said the captain, “was to be encountered in the persons of numerous snakes lurking in the old walls and on the weed-covered ground, which endangered the life of the traveller at every step.”  We were perfectly well aware of these facts, having gleaned them partly from descriptions of voyages, partly from oral traditions; and so they were not powerful enough to arrest our curiosity.  The captain himself was really less actuated by the sense of our danger, in advising us to abandon our undertaking, than by the reflection of the time it lost him; but he exerted himself in vain.  He was obliged to cast anchor, and at daybreak to send a boat ashore with us.

Our arms consisted of parasols and sticks (the latter we carried in order to beat the bushes); we were escorted by the captain, his servant, and a couple of sailors.

In the ruins we certainly met with a few suspicious-looking characters in the shape of wandering Bedouins.  As it was too late to beat a retreat, we advanced bravely towards them with trusting and friendly looks.  The Bedouins did the same, and so there was an end of this dangerous affair.  We climbed from one fragment to another, and certainly spent more than two hours among the ruins, without sustaining the slightest injury at the hands of these people.  Of the threatened snakes we saw not a single one.

Ruins, indeed, we found every where in plenty.  Whole side-walls, which appeared to have belonged to private houses, but not to splendid palaces or temples, stood erect and almost unscathed.  Fragments of pillars lay scattered about in great abundance, but without capitals, pedestals, or friezes.

It was with a feeling of awe hitherto unknown to me that I trod the ground where my Redeemer had walked.  Every spot, every building became invested with a double interest.  “Perchance,” I thought, “I may be lingering within the very house where Jesus once sojourned.”  More than satisfied with my excursion, I returned to our bark.

By three o’clock in the afternoon we were close under the walls of Joppa.  To enter this harbour, partially choked up as it is with sand, is described as a difficult feat.  We were assured that we should see many wrecks of stranded ships and boats; accordingly I strained my eyes to the utmost, and could discover nothing.  We ran safely in; and thus ended a little journey in the course of which I had seen many new and interesting objects, besides gaining some insight into the mode of life among the sailors.  Frequently, when it fell calm, our Arabs would recline on the ground in a circle, singing songs of an inconceivably inharmonious and lugubrious character, while they clapped their hands in cadence, and burst at intervals into a barking laugh.

Bethlehem,Bethlehem,31.7054,35.2024,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"Bethlehem lies on a hill, surrounded by several others; with the exception of the convent, it contains not a single handsome building.  The inhabitants, half of whom are Catholics, muster about 2500 strong; many live in grottoes and semi-subterranean domiciles, cutting out garlands and other devices in mother-of pearl, etc.  The number of houses does not exceed a hundred at the most, and the poverty here seems excessive, for nowhere have I been so much pestered with beggar children as in this town.  Hardly has the stranger reached the convent-gates before these urchins are seen rapidly approaching from all quarters.  One rushes forward to hold the horse, while a second grasps the stirrup; a third and a fourth present their arm to help you to dismount; and in the end the whole swarm unanimously stretch forth their hands for “backsheesh.”  In cases like these it is quite necessary to come furnished either with a multiplicity of small coins or with a riding-whip, in order to be delivered in one way or another from the horrible importunity of the diminutive mob.  It is very fortunate that the horses here are perfectly accustomed to such scenes; were this not the case, they would take fright and gallop headlong away.

The little convent and church are both situated near the town, and are built on the spot where the Saviour was born.  The whole is surrounded by a strong fortress-wall, a very low, narrow gate forming the entrance.  In front of this fortress extends a handsome well-paved area.  So soon as we have passed through the little gate, we find ourselves in the courtyard, or rather in the nave of the church, which is unfortunately more than half destroyed, but must once have been eminent both for its size and beauty.  Some traces of mosaic can still be detected on the walls.  Two rows of high handsome pillars, forty-eight in number, intersect the interior; and the beam-work, said to be of cedar-wood from Lebanon, looks almost new.  Beneath the high altar of this great church is the grotto in which Christ was born.  Two staircases lead downwards to it.  One of the staircases belongs to the Armenians, the other to the Greeks; the Catholics have none at all.  Both the walls and the floor are covered with marble slabs.  A marble tablet, with the inscription,

“HIC DE VIRGINE MARIA JESUS CHRISTUS NATUS EST,”

marks the spot whence the true Light shone abroad over the world.  A figure of a beaming sun, which receives its light from numerous lamps kept continually burning, is placed in the back-ground of this tablet.

The spot where our Saviour was shewn to the worshipping Magi is but few paces distant.  An altar is erected opposite, on the place where the manger stood in which the shepherds found our Lord.  The manger itself is deposited in the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome.  This altar belongs to the Roman Catholics.  A little door, quite in the background of the grotto, leads to a subterranean passage communicating with the convent and the Catholic chapel.  In this passage another altar has been erected to the memory of the innocents slaughtered and buried here.  Proceeding along the passage we come upon the grave of St. Paula and her daughter Eustachia on one side, and that of St. Hieronymus on the other.  The body of the latter is, however, deposited at Rome.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Nazareth,Nazareth ,32.6996,35.3035,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"t was only nine o’clock when we reached Nazareth, and repaired to the house for strangers in the Franciscan convent, where the priests welcomed us very kindly.  As soon as we had made a short survey of our rooms (which resulted in our finding them very like those at Jerusalem, both as regards appearance and arrangement), we set forth once more to visit all the remarkable places, and above all the church which contains the Grotto of Annunciation.  This church, to which we were accompanied by a clergyman, was built by St. Helena, and is of no great size.  In the background a staircase leads down into the grotto, where it is asserted that the Virgin Mary received the Lord’s message from the angel.  Three little pillars of granite are still to be seen in this grotto.  The lower part of one of these pillars was broken away by the Turks, so that it is only fastened from above.  On the strength of this circumstance many have averred that the pillar hangs suspended in air!  Had these men but looked beyond their noses, had they only cast their eyes upwards, they could not have had the face to preach a miracle where it is so palpable that none exists.  A picture on the wall, not badly executed, represents the Annunciation.  The house of the Virgin is not shewn here, because, according to the legend, an angel carried it away to Loretto in Italy.  A few steps lead to another grotto, affirmed to be the residence of a neighbour of the Virgin, during whose absence she presided over the house and attended to the duties of the absent Mary.

Another grotto in the town is shewn as “the workshop of Joseph;” it has been left in its primitive state, except that a plain wooden altar has been added.  Not far off we find the synagogue where our Lord taught the people, thereby exasperating the Pharisees to such a degree, that they wished to cast Him down from a rock outside the city.  In conclusion we were shewn an immense block of stone on which the Saviour is said to have eaten the Passover with His disciples(!).

In the afternoon we went to see “Mary’s Well,” on the road to Tabarith, at a short distance from Nazareth.  This well is fenced round with masonry, and affords pure clear water.  Hither, it is said, the Virgin came every day to draw water, and here the women and girls of Nazareth may still be daily seen walking to and fro with pitchers on their shoulders.  Those whom we saw were all poorly clad, and looked dirty.  Many wore no covering on their head, and, what was far worse, their hair hung down in a most untidy manner.  Their bright eyes were the only handsome feature these people possessed.  The custom of wearing silver coins round the head also prevailed here.

To-day was a day of misfortunes for me; in the morning, when we departed from Lagun, I had already felt unwell.  On the road I was seized with violent headache, nausea, and feverish shiverings, so that I hardly thought I should be able to reach Nazareth.  The worst of all this was, that I felt obliged to hide my illness, as I had done on our journey to Jerusalem, for fear I should be left behind.  The wish to view all the holy places in Nazareth was also so powerful within me, that I made a great effort, and accompanied the rest of my party for the whole day, though I was obliged every moment to retire into the background that my condition might not be observed.  But when we went to table, the smell of the viands produced such an effect upon me, that I hastily held my handkerchief before my face as though my nose were bleeding, and hurried out.  Thanks to my sunburnt skin, through which no paleness could penetrate, no one noticed that I was ill.  The whole day long I could eat nothing; but towards evening I recovered a little.  My appetite now also returned, but unfortunately nothing was to be had but some bad mutton-broth and an omelette made with rancid oil.  It is bad enough to be obliged to subsist on such fare when we are in health, but the hardship increases tenfold when we are ill.  However, I sent for some bread and wine, and strengthened myself therewith as best I might.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Damascus,Damascus,33.5138,36.2765,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"Damascus is one of the most ancient cities of the East, but yet we see no ruins; a proof that no grand buildings ever existed here, and that therefore the houses, as they became old and useless, were replaced by new ones.

To-day we visited the seat of all the riches—the great bazaar.  It is mostly covered in, but only with beams and straw mats.  On both sides are rows of wooden booths, containing all kinds of articles, but a great preponderance of eatables, which are sold at an extraordinarily cheap rate.  We found the “mish-mish” particularly good.

As in Constantinople, the rarest and most costly of the wares are not exposed for sale, but must be sought for in closed store-houses.  The booths look like inferior hucksters’ shops, and each merchant is seen sitting in the midst of his goods.  We passed hastily through the bazaar, in order soon to reach the great mosque, situate in the midst of it.  As we were forbidden, however, not only to enter the mosque, but even the courtyard, we were obliged to content ourselves with wondering at the immense portals, and stealing furtive glances at the interior of the open space beyond.  This mosque was originally a Christian church; and a legend tells that St. George was decapitated here.

The khan, also situate in the midst of the bazaar, is peculiarly fine, and is said to be the best in all the East.  The high and boldly-arched portal is covered with marble, and enriched with beautiful sculptures.  The interior forms a vast rotunda, surrounded by galleries, divided from each other, and furnished with writing-tables for the use of the merchants.  Below in the hall the bales and chests are piled up, and at the side are apartments for travelling dealers.  The greater portion of the floor and the walls is covered with marble.

Altogether, marble seems to be much sought after at Damascus.  Every thing that passes for beautiful or valuable is either entirely composed of this stone, or at least is inlaid with it.  Thus a pretty fountain in a little square near the bazaar is of marble; and a coffee-house opposite the fountain, the largest and most frequented of any in Damascus, is ornamented with a few small marble pillars.  But all these buildings, not even excepting the great bathing-house, would be far less praised and looked at if they stood in a better neighbourhood.  As the case is, however, they shine forth nobly from among the clay houses of Damascus.

In the afternoon we visited the Grotto of St. Paul, lying immediately outside the town.  On the ramparts we were shewn the place where the apostle is said to have leaped from the wall on horseback, reaching the ground in safety, and taking refuge from his enemies in the neighbouring grotto, which is said to have closed behind him by miracle, and not to have opened again until his persecutors had ceased their pursuit.  At present, nothing is to be seen of this grotto excepting a small stone archway, like that of a bridge.  Tombs of modern date, consisting of vaults covered with large blocks of stone, are very numerous near this grotto.

We paid several more visits, and every where found great pomp of inner arrangement and decoration, varying of course in different houses.  We were always served with coffee, sherbet, and argilé; and in the houses of the Turks a dreary conversation was carried on through the medium of an interpreter.

Walks and places of amusement there are none.  The number of Franks resident here is too small to call for a place of general recreation, and the Turk never feels a want of this kind.  The most he does is to saunter slowly from the bath to the coffee-house, and there to kill his time with the help of a pipe and a cup of coffee, staring vacantly on the ground before him.  Although the coffee-houses are more frequented than any other buildings in the East, they are often miserable sheds, being all small, and generally built only of wood.

The inhabitants of Damascus wear the usual Oriental garb, but as a rule I thought them better dressed than in any Eastern town.  Some of the women are veiled, but others go abroad with their faces uncovered.  I saw here some very attractive countenances; and an unusual number of lovely children’s heads looked at me from all sides with an inquisitive smile.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

Cairo ,Cairo,30.0444,31.2357,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"The aspect of this great Egyptian metropolis is not nearly so imposing as I had fancied it to be; its situation is too flat, and from on board we can only discern scattered portions of its extended area.  The gardens skirting the shore are luxuriant and lovely.

At my debarcation, and on the road to the consulate, I met with several adventures, which I relate circumstantially, trifling as they may appear, in order to give a hint as to the best method of dealing with the people here.

At the very commencement I became involved in a dispute with the captain of the vessel.  I had still to pay him three dollars and a half, and gave him four dollars, in the expectation that he would return me my change.  This, however, he refused to do, and persisted in keeping the half-dollar.  He said it should be divided as backsheesh among the crew; but I am sure they would have seen nothing of it.  Luckily, however, he was stupid enough not to put the money in his pocket, but kept it open in his hand.  I quickly snatched a coin from him, and put it into my pocket, explaining to him at the same time that he should not have it back until he had given me my change, adding that I would give the men a gratuity myself.  He shouted and stormed, and kept on asking for the money.  I took no heed of him, but continued quietly packing up my things.  Seeing, at length, that nothing was to be done with me, he gave me back my half-dollar; whereupon we parted good friends.  This affair concluded, I had to look about for a couple of asses; one for myself, and another for my luggage.  If I had stepped ashore I should have been almost torn in pieces by contending donkey-drivers, each of whom would have lugged me in a different direction.  I therefore remained quietly for a time in my cabin, until the drivers ceased to suspect that any one was there.  In the meantime I had been looking upon the shore from the cabin-window, and speculating upon which animal I should take; then I quickly rushed out, and before the proprietors of the long-eared steeds were aware of my intention, I had seized one by the bridle and pointed to another.  This concluded the matter at once; for the proprietors of the chosen animals defended me from the rest, and returned with me to the boat to carry my baggage.

A fellow came up and arranged my little trunk on the back of the ass.  For this trifling service I gave him a piastre; but observing that I was alone, he probably thought he could soon intimidate me into giving whatever he demanded.  So he returned me my piastre, and demanded four.  I took the money, and told him (for fortunately he understood a little Italian) that if he felt dissatisfied with this reward he might accompany me to the consulate, where his four piastres would be paid so soon as it appeared that he had earned them.  He shouted and blustered, just as the captain had done; but I remained deaf, and rode forward towards the custom-house.  Then he came down to three piastres, then to two, and finally said he would be content with one, which I threw to him.  When I reached the custom-house, hands were stretched out towards me from all sides; I gave something to the chief person, and let the remaining ones clamour on.  When, after experiencing these various annoyances, I rode on towards the town, a new obstacle arose.  My Arab guide inquired whither he should conduct me.  I endeavoured in vain to explain to him where I wanted to go; he could not be made to understand me.  Nothing now remained for me but to accost every well-dressed Oriental whom I met, until I should find one who could understand either French or Italian.  The third person I addressed fortunately knew something of the latter language, and I begged him to tell my guide to take me to the Austrian consulate.  This was done, and my troubles concluded.

A ride of three quarters of an hour in a very broad handsome street, planted with a double row of a kind of acacia altogether strange to me, among a crowd of men, camels, asses, etc., brought me to the town, the streets of which are in general narrow.  There is so much noise and crowding every where, that one would suppose a tumult had broken out.  But as I approached, the immense mass always opened as if by magic, and I pursued my way without hindrance to the consulate, which lies hidden in a little narrow blind alley.

I went immediately to the office, and presented myself to the consul, with the request that he would recommend me a respectable inn of the second class.  Herr Chamgion, the consul, interested himself for me with heartfelt kindness; he immediately despatched a kavasse to an innkeeper whom he knew, paid my guide, and recommended the host strongly to take good care of me; in short, he behaved towards me with true Christian kindliness.  His house was ever open to me, and I could go to him with any petition I wished to make.  It is a real pleasure to me to be able publicly once more to thank this worthy man.

I had been furnished with a letter of recommendation to a certain Herr Palm.  The consul kindly sent at once for this gentleman, who soon appeared, and accompanied me to the inn.

I requested Herr P. to recommend me a servant who could either speak Italian or French, and afterwards to tell me the best method to set about seeing the lions of the town.  Herr P. very willingly undertook to do so; and after the lapse of an hour, the dragoman had already been found, and two asses stood before the door to carry me and my servant through the whole town.

The animated bustle and hum of business in the streets of Cairo is very great.  I can even say that in the most populous cities of Italy I never saw any thing I could compare to it; and certainly this is a bold assertion.

Many of the streets are so narrow, that when loaded camels meet, one party must always be led into a by-street until the other has passed.  In these narrow lanes I continually encountered crowds of passengers, so that I really felt quite anxious, and wondered how I should find my way through.  People mounted on horses and donkeys tower above the moving mass; but the asses themselves appear like pigmies beside the high, lofty-looking camels, which do not lose their proud demeanour even under their heavy burdens.  Men often slip by under the heads of the camels.  The riders keep as close as possible to the houses, and the mass of pedestrians winds dexterously between.  There are water-carriers, vendors of goods, numerous blind men groping their way with sticks, and bearing baskets with fruit, bread, and other provisions for sale; numerous children, some of them running about the streets, and others playing before the house-doors; and lastly, the Egyptian ladies, who ride on asses to pay their visits, and come in long processions with their children and negro servants.  Let the reader further imagine the cries of the vendors, the shouting of the drivers and passengers, the terrified screams of flying women and children, the quarrels which frequently arise, and the peculiar noisiness and talkativeness of these people, and he can fancy what an effect this must have on the nerves of a stranger.  I was in mortal fear at every step, and on reaching home in the evening felt quite unwell; but as I never once saw an accident occur, I at length accustomed myself to the hubbub, and could follow my guide where the crowd was thickest without feeling uneasy.
The aspect of this great Egyptian metropolis is not nearly so imposing as I had fancied it to be; its situation is too flat, and from on board we can only discern scattered portions of its extended area.  The gardens skirting the shore are luxuriant and lovely.

Seeing, at length, that nothing was to be done with me, he gave me back my half-dollar; whereupon we parted good friends.  This affair concluded, I had to look about for a couple of asses; one for myself, and another for my luggage.  If I had stepped ashore I should have been almost torn in pieces by contending donkey-drivers, each of whom would have lugged me in a different direction.  I therefore remained quietly for a time in my cabin, until the drivers ceased to suspect that any one was there.  In the meantime I had been looking upon the shore from the cabin-window, and speculating upon which animal I should take; then I quickly rushed out, and before the proprietors of the long-eared steeds were aware of my intention, I had seized one by the bridle and pointed to another.  This concluded the matter at once; for the proprietors of the chosen animals defended me from the rest, and returned with me to the boat to carry my baggage.

A fellow came up and arranged my little trunk on the back of the ass.  For this trifling service I gave him a piastre; but observing that I was alone, he probably thought he could soon intimidate me into giving whatever he demanded.  So he returned me my piastre, and demanded four.  I took the money, and told him (for fortunately he understood a little Italian) that if he felt dissatisfied with this reward he might accompany me to the consulate, where his four piastres would be paid so soon as it appeared that he had earned them.  He shouted and blustered, just as the captain had done; but I remained deaf, and rode forward towards the custom-house.  Then he came down to three piastres, then to two, and finally said he would be content with one, which I threw to him.  When I reached the custom-house, hands were stretched out towards me from all sides; I gave something to the chief person, and let the remaining ones clamour on.  When, after experiencing these various annoyances, I rode on towards the town, a new obstacle arose.  My Arab guide inquired whither he should conduct me.  I endeavoured in vain to explain to him where I wanted to go; he could not be made to understand me.  Nothing now remained for me but to accost every well-dressed Oriental whom I met, until I should find one who could understand either French or Italian.  The third person I addressed fortunately knew something of the latter language, and I begged him to tell my guide to take me to the Austrian consulate.  This was done, and my troubles concluded.

A ride of three quarters of an hour in a very broad handsome street, planted with a double row of a kind of acacia altogether strange to me, among a crowd of men, camels, asses, etc., brought me to the town, the streets of which are in general narrow.  There is so much noise and crowding every where, that one would suppose a tumult had broken out.  But as I approached, the immense mass always opened as if by magic, and I pursued my way without hindrance to the consulate, which lies hidden in a little narrow blind alley.

I went immediately to the office, and presented myself to the consul, with the request that he would recommend me a respectable inn of the second class.  Herr Chamgion, the consul, interested himself for me with heartfelt kindness; he immediately despatched a kavasse to an innkeeper whom he knew, paid my guide, and recommended the host strongly to take good care of me; in short, he behaved towards me with true Christian kindliness.  His house was ever open to me, and I could go to him with any petition I wished to make.  It is a real pleasure to me to be able publicly once more to thank this worthy man.

I had been furnished with a letter of recommendation to a certain Herr Palm.  The consul kindly sent at once for this gentleman, who soon appeared, and accompanied me to the inn.

Rome,Rome,41.9028,12.4964,Ida Pfeiffer,1842,"As we approach Rome the country becomes more and more barren; the mountains recede, and the extended plains have a desert, uncultivated look.  Towns and villages become so thinly scattered, that it seems as though the whole region were depopulated.  The road is rather narrow, and as the country is in many places exceedingly marshy, a great portion of it has been paved.  For many miles before we enter Rome we do not pass a single town or village.  At length, some three hours before we reach the city, the dome of St. Peter’s is seen looming in the distance; one church after another appears, and at length the whole city lies spread before us.

Many ruins of aqueducts and buildings of every kind shewed at every step what treasures of the past here awaited us.  I was particularly pleased with the old town-gate Lateran, by which we entered.

It was already quite dark when we reached the Dogana.  I at once betook myself to my room and retired to rest.

I remained a fortnight at Rome, and walked about the streets from morning till night.  I visited St. Peter’s almost every day, and went to the Vatican several times.

All the squares in Rome (and there are a great many) are decorated with fountains, and still more frequently with obelisks.  The finest is the Piazza del Popolo.  To the right rises the terrace-hill Picino, rich in pillars, statues, fountains, and other ornaments,—a favourite walk of the citizens.  On this hill, which is arranged after the manner of a beautiful garden, we have a splendid view.  The city of Rome here appears to much greater advantage than when we approach it from the direction of Naples.  We can see the whole town at one glance, with the yellow Tiber flowing through the midst, and a vast plain all around.  The background is closed by beautiful mountain-ranges, with villas, little towns, and cottages on the declivities.  But I missed one feature, to which I had become so accustomed that the most beautiful view appeared incomplete without it—the sea.  To make up for this drawback, we here encounter wherever we walk such a number of ruins, that we soon become forgetful of all around us, and live only in the past.

The Piazza del Popolo forms the termination of the three principal streets in Rome; on the largest and finest of these, the Corso, many palaces are to be seen.

The splendid post-office, of white marble, rises on the Colonna square.  Two clocks are erected on this building; one with our dial, one with the Italian.  At night both are illuminated,—a very useful as well as an ornamental arrangement.  The ancient column of Antoninus also stands in this square.

The façade of the Dogana boasts some pillars from the temple of Antonius Pius.

The objects I have just enumerated struck me particularly as I wended my way to St. Peter’s.  I cannot describe how deeply I was impressed by the sight of this colossal structure.  I need only state the fact, that on the first day I entered the cathedral at nine in the morning, and did not emerge from its gates until three in the afternoon.

I sat down before the pictures in mosaic, underneath the huge dome and the canopy; then I stood before the statues and monuments, and could only gaze in wonder at every thing.

The expense of building and decorating this church is said to have amounted to 45,852,000 dollars.  It occupies the site of Nero’s circus.  Two arcades, with four rows of pillars and ninety-six statues, surround the square leading to the church.

The façade of St. Peter’s is decorated with Corinthian pillars, and on its parapet stand statues fifty-two feet in height.

The entrance is so crowded with statues, carved work, and gilding, that several hours may be spent in examining its wonders.  The traveller’s attention is particularly attracted by the gigantic gates of bronze.

I cannot adequately describe the splendour of the interior, nor have I seen any thing with which I could compare it.

The most beautiful mosaics, monuments, statues, carvings in bronze, gilded ornaments, in short every thing that art can produce, are here to be found in the highest perfection.  Oil-paintings alone are excluded.  Every thing here is in mosaic; even the cupola displays mosaic work instead of the usual fresco-paintings.  Immense statues of white marble occupy the niches.

Beneath the cupola, the finest portion of the building, stands the great altar, at which none but the Pope may read mass.  Over this altar extends a giant canopy of bronze, with spiral pillars richly decorated with arabesques.  The weight of metal used in its construction was 186,392 pounds, and the cost of the gold for gilding was 40,000 dollars; the entire canopy is worth above 150,000 dollars.  The cupola was executed by Michael Angelo; it rests on four massive pillars, each of them furnished with a balcony.  In the interior of these pillars chapels are constructed, where the chief relics are kept, and only displayed to the people from the balcony at particular times.  I was in the church at the time when the handkerchief which wiped the drops of agony from our Lord’s brow, and a piece of the true cross, were shewn.

The pulpit stands in a very elevated position, and was executed in bronze by Bernini; 219,161 pounds of metal, and 172,000 dollars, were spent upon its construction.  In the interior is concealed the wooden pulpit from which St. Peter preached; and immediately beside this we find a pillar of white marble, said to have belonged to Solomon’s temple at Jerusalem.

The lions on the monument of Clement XIII., by Canova, are considered the finest that were ever sculptured.

I was fortunate enough to penetrate into the catacombs of St. Peter’s, a favour which women rarely obtain, and which I only owed to my having been a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.  These catacombs consist of handsome passages and pillars of masonry, which do not, however, exceed eight or nine feet in height.  A number of sarcophagi, containing the remains of emperors and popes, are here deposited.","Ida Pfeiffer, Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy, trans. by H.W.

New Orleans,"New Orleans, Louisana",29.9368,-90.0813,Henry Murray,1857,"New Orleans is a surprising evidence of what men will endure, when cheered by the hopes of an ever-flowing tide of all-mighty dollars and cents. It is situated on a marsh, and bounded by the river on one side, and on the other by a continuation of the marsh on which it is built, beyond which extends a forest swamp. All sewerage and drainage is superficial—more generally covered in, but in very many places dragging its sluggish stream, under the broad light of day, along the edges of the footway. The chief business is, of course, in those streets skirting the river; and at this season—December—when the cotton and sugar mania is at its height, the bustle and activity is marvellous. Streets are piled in every direction with mounds of cotton, which rise as high as the roofs; storehouses are bursting with bales; steam and hydraulic presses hiss in your ear at every tenth step, and beneath their power the downy fibre is compressed into a substance as hard as Aberdeen granite, which semi-nude negroes bind, roll, and wheel in all directions, the exertion keeping them in perpetual self-supplying animal steam-baths. Gigantic mules arrive incessantly, dragging fresh freight for pressure; while others as incessantly depart, bearing freight for embarkation to Europe..... In the old, or French part, the streets are generally very narrow; but in the American, or the La Fayette quarter, they are very broad, and, whether from indolence or some other reason, badly paved and worse cleansed; nevertheless, if the streets are dirty and muddy, the houses have the advantage of being airy.","Henry Murray, Lands of The Slave and The Free; or, Cuba, The United States, and Canada (New York: Routledge & Co., 1857), 140-1.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02857/02857.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America
Richmond,"Richmond, Virginia",37.5335,-77.4364,Henry Murray,1857,"Richmond is a lovely spot, situated on the northern bank of James River, one hundred and fifty miles from the sea, and is the capital of Virginia. It contains nearly 30,000 inhabitants who 1000 are slaves. Being built upon several hills, it is free from the eternal sameness of level and regularity of lines which tire the eye so much in New York, Philadelphia, &e., and its site resembles more that of Boston or Baltimore. The James River is navigable for small vessels as high as Richmond; but just above the town there is a barrier which arrests alike the navigator's course and the traveller's eye. This barrier is called the Rapids, and is a most beautiful feature in the scenery....There are various public buildings here, among the most conspicuous of which is the Capitol, built in the great public square, and from its summit commanding a splendid panoramic view. There are also about thirty churches, one of which, the Monumental Church—which is Episcopalian—stands upon ground of melancholy recollections; for here, in 1811, stood the theatre, which during that year was utterly consumed by a fire, in which the governor and scores of other human beings perished.","Henry Murray, Lands of The Slave and The Free; or, Cuba, The United States, and Canada (New York: Routledge & Co., 1857), 216-20.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02857/02857.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America
New York City,"New York City, New York",40.719,-74.0061,Henry Latham,1866,"The stores of the Broadway are the most wonderful glorified shops ever seen. Something between a Manchester warehouse and a London clubhouse. Everybody is talking so much of the rush there will be to the Exhibition in Paris, that we have actually been this day to the Cunard Office, and secured passages back to England, to sail from New York on March 20th; some ten days after which, au revoir. I have spent all my day in going to and fro in Broadway, the wonderful street of New York; in ten years' time the finest street in the world. At present, there are still so many small old houses standing in line with the enormous stores, that the effect is somewhat spoilt, by reason of the ranks not being well dressed. Broadway is now much in the condition of a child's mouth when cutting its second set of teeth; slightly gappy. The enormous stores look even larger now than they will do when the intervals are filled up. The external splendour of the shops is chiefly architectural; they make no great display of goods in the windows; but the large size of the rooms with enables them to set out and exhibit many times the amount of goods that an English shopkeeper shows. The city of New York is on the southern point of Manhattan island; having the East River running along one side, and the North River or Hudson along the other. Some day far in the future, when the present municipality is purged or swept away, and the splendour of the Thames Embankment scheme has been realised, New York will probably have two lines of quays, planted with trees and edged with warehouses, which will make it one of the finest cities in the world. The business quarter is at the point of the peninsula. The fashionable quarter is to the North, reaching every year farther inland. As the city increases, the stores keep moving Northwards, taking possession of the houses, and driving the residents farther back. The land is not yet built over up to Central Park, said to be so called because it will be the future centre of the city that is to be....New York is not a difficult city to find your way about in. Along every Avenue runs a line of Street Cars on an iron tramway. The cars take you for ten cents currency, about fourpence English, from one end of the city to the other. The Avenues are the streets which run the length of the city from North to South, parallel to Broadway; and are called First, Second, Third Avenue, numbering from the East. The streets run at right angles to the Avenues; and are called on the one side of Broadway First, Second, and Third East Street, and on the other side of Broadway First, Second, and Third West Street. The whole city is shaped somewhat like a kite, with Broadway for the wooden rib in the middle. The method and arrangement is admirable, but the rate at which you move on wheels would excite the contempt of a London cabby. There are two Hansome cabs in New York, but they do not take; horses are falling down too much just now.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 7-10.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",39.9377,-75.167,Henry Latham,1866,"Philadelphia is a most difficult town just now for pedestrians, the doorsteps being all of white marble glazed with ice; and sliding on the pavement may be had in perfection. Spent the best part of the day in slipping about, trying to deliver letters of introduction. The system of naming the streets of Philadelphia and of numbering the houses is extremely ingenious, and answers perfectly when you have made yourself acquainted with it; but as it takes an ordinary mind a week to find it out, the stranger who stops four or five days is apt to execrate it. All the streets run at right angles to one another, so that a short cut, the joy of the accomplished Londoner, is impossible. It is a chessboard upon which the Bishop's move is unknown. Nothing diagonal can be done. The city is ruled like a page of a ledger, from top to bottom with streets, from side to side with avenues. It is all divided into squares. When you are first told this, a vision arises of the possibility of cutting across these squares from corner to corner. Not a bit of it—a square at Philadelphia means a solid block of houses, not an open space enclosed by buildings. When you have wandered about for some time, the idea suggests itself that every house is exactly like the house next to it; although the inhabitants have given up the old uniformity of costume, the houses have not; and without this elaborate system of numbering, the inhabitants of Philadelphia would never be able to find their way home. Nevertheless, if that is the finest town in which its inhabitants are best lodged, Philadelphia is the finest town in the world. It lodges a much smaller population than that of New York in more houses. In no other large town are rents comparatively so cheap. Every decent working-man can afford to have his separate house, with gas and water laid on, and fitted with a bath.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 15-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
"Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C.",38.8903,-77.0036,Henry Latham,1867,"We went this morning over the Capitol, an enormous edifice still in progress; parts of it are continually built on to, and rebuilt, to meet the wants of the legislature. The two new white marble wings are very beautiful, and nearly complete, and the dome is on the same scale with them, and of the same material. The centre is now out of proportion since the wings were built, and is of stone, painted white to match the rest in colour and preserve it from the frost. If the South had succeeded in seceding, it might have sufficed; but now it is bound to grow, and Congress are going to vote the amount of dollars necessary to make the Capitol complete. When completed it will be magnificent. We are very unlucky in seeing these great marble palaces (for several of the public buildings of Washington are of this material) with the snow upon the ground. Against the pure white snow they appear dingy; under a summer sun they must show to far greater advantage. What ancient Athens appeared like, surrounding its marble temples, I can hardly realise; but the effect of the splendid public buildings in Washington is very much detracted from by the sheds and shanties which are near them. The builders of Washington determined that it should be a great city, and staked out its streets accordingly twice the width and length of any other streets: rightly is it named the city of magnificent distances. But although the Potomac is certainly wide enough, and apparently deep enough, to justify a certain amount of trade, and its situation is more central than that of Philadelphia, the town has never grown to fill the outlines traced for it. To make a Washington street, take one marble temple or public office, a dozen good houses of brick, and a dozen of wood, and fill in with sheds and fields. Some blight seems to have fallen upon the city. It is the only place we have seen which is not full of growth and vitality. I have even heard its inhabitants tell stories of nightly pig-hunts in the streets, and of the danger of tumbling over a cow on the pavement on a dark night; but this must refer to bygone times.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 58-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Richmond,"Richmond, Virginia",37.5335,-77.4364,Henry Latham,1867,"Got a carriage driven by a nice intelligent negro, and drove out to see the lines. Those we saw consisted of a line of forts, encircling Richmond, earthworks, generally open to the rear, about two miles from the town, and about half a mile apart, each road approaching the town is also protected by earthworks. The most conspicuous weathercock in the town is a golden trumpet on the spire of one of the churches—no bad symbol of beleaguered Richmond, to which the wind brought tidings of war from whichever side it blew. Saw four turkey buzzards sitting on a rail, looking exactly like disreputable turkeys; they are the scavengers of this country. During the war time they are said all to have disappeared from Richmond, there was so much better feasting outside. When the Confederates marched out, the town was set on fire in the tumult. It was nobody's business or care to put it out, and according to our landlord, 1,244 buildings, valued at 3,000,000 dollars, were burnt. About one-half of the space cleared by the fire is now covered again with large handsome stores, said to be double the size of those they replaced. These are being built by Richmond men, but not by the owners of the former stores. Richmond is very different in appearance from any city we have passed through yet; it looks nearly a century older. You see in the suburbs a great many houses which look like the town-residences of well-to-do gentry. Some of these have large Grecian porticoes for shade, and others verandas, story above story, large enough to be in fact a set of open-air summer-rooms, showing that it is hot here sometimes, though cold enough at present.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 100-1.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America
Atlanta,"Atlanta, Georgia",33.7565,-84.392,Henry Latham,1867,"At 10.30 a.m. we arrived at Atlanta. Here we come upon the track of Sherman's terrible march. He burnt Atlanta to the ground, leaving only two stores standing. The old wooden town is now nearly re-built of brick. We have now glorious summer weather; making us rejoice that we have postponed going north, where all the world is snowed up, and trains are being dug out of the drifts: many stories in the papers also of gales upon the eastern coast, and wrecks about Cape Hatteras, causing me to rejoice that we had not gone south by ship as proposed at one time. As we approached Atlanta the country became more cleared and cultivated. Sixteen miles before reaching it, our eyes were rejoiced by the sight of Stone Mountain, a bare granite bluff, the first hill we have seen in America. The whole coast-line, down which we have travelled, appears to be one level flat. A good deal of stone is being quarried here for the new buildings at Atlanta. The city of Atlanta seems to have no particular natural advantages, but derives its importance from being situated at the junction of four railroads, which run north to Chattanooga, south to Macon, east to Charleston, and west to Montgomery.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 129-30.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America
Mobile,"Mobile, Alabama",30.6933,-88.0428,Henry Latham,1867,"Mobile seems to have suffered little from the war, except by impoverishment and stagnation of trade. It was one of the last places which surrendered to the North. Admiral Farragut defeated the Confederate gun-boats in Mobile Bay, and took the town without its passing through the ordeal of either burning or bombardment. The great devastation was committed by the inhabitants themselves, who now lament bitterly that, in clearing the ground for fortifications which were never used, they cut down the whole of the fine evergreen oaks and magnolias which formerly shaded the suburbs. We were driven to-day along the ‘Shell-road,’ which skirts the western side of the bay. Mobile oysters are beautiful when fried, and after death the shells are made into the smoothest of turnpike roads. Before the war this road ran through a wood of magnificent magnolias, which when in blossom used to fill the air with perfume. The part of the grove next to the town is all swept away, the trees which shaded the citizens' summer evening drive have been felled. Camellias grow here in the gardens, ten feet high; and roses and jonquils are in blossom. Palmettoes grow along the shore, and one house in Government Street had an orange-tree growing on the turf, covered with large dark-red oranges. Several of the best houses in Government Street are said to be tenanted by the former owners of blockade-runners; a trade in which the Jews largely embarked.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 145-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America

It contains about 200,000 inhabitants, and before the war was the chief market of the world for cotton, and the chief market of the United States for sugar. During the war, the market of New Orleans was closed. The year before the war, Louisiana could show 1,292 plantations under cultivation, producing 500,000 hogsheads of sugar. In 1864 there were but 180 plantations at work, and their production of sugar was but 6,750 hogsheads. Ninetenths of the sugar-cane raised in the U. S. is grown in Louisiana. Before the war, Cuba sent her sugars to New Orleans to be sold; at present they go to New York. The natural market is beginning now, as the Americans say, to ‘recuperate;’ and our walk on the Levée was very amusing.","Henry Latham, Black and White: A Journal of a Three Months' Tour in The United States (London: Macmillan and Co., 1867), 148.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03380/03380.pdf,United States of America,South Eastern North America,North America
Quebec,"Québec City, Quebec",46.8101,-71.2218,John James Aubertin,1886,"As regards Quebec itself, after coursing it about, 20 I cannot speak of its great beauties. And one feature seemed to me to be offensive—the spurious glittering of tin roofs over many of the houses, and even of some otherwise solidly put together. The effect of this metal is even worse than that produced by corrugated iron. If you would insist on metal roofs, they should be of copper, both for durability and beauty. Copper lasts well, and soon takes on a most picturesque olive-green tint. A very striking effect of copper roofing may be realized in a view of Moscow, something very different indeed from that produced by the tin roofing of Quebec. Though I heard nothing but curious English and curious French among the general frequenters of the streets, yet there was something among many of them that reminded one, in their look and gait (though not particularly in their brogue), of Tipperary men.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 20.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,Canada,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Montreal,"Montreal, Quebec",45.4955,-73.5755,John James Aubertin,1886,"The first view of this great city from the river struck me as being flat and smoky, and particularly so as coming immediately after Quebec. But this deficiency in aspect proves its superiority as a living and still growing city, the first sign of which is seen in its magnificent stone quays and its lines of warehouses. The immense quantity of wood, planked and stacked for sale, may be a common feature to a good many persons, but it was most surprising to me. We landed and found our way to the great Windsor Hotel, an enormous house, and here we found evidence of the Parisian having safely arrived before us by the presence of Captain Wylie, looking very bright and jolly, and very glad to see us. At this hotel I first realized the general features of the great hotels of the States, of which I shall have to speak by-and-by, so that I will not enter into particulars on the subject here. And if I were to begin to show how Montreal is a fine large city with fine large buildings, and with a very great number of churches, I might be met with the remark, “Of course it is.” But among the buildings most spoken of, I must confess that the yet incomplete Cathedral of St. Peter presented to me nothing that could recall what it is declared to intend to represent on a somewhat smaller scale—the great Basilica at Rome. If you would desire a fine and impressive view of the city, you must ascend Mont Real (or Mount Royal) behind, and survey the impressive scene, reflecting on all the wealth and commerce that is in active and constant movement among the thousands below, belonging to the largest and most important city of the Dominion. The well-wooded sides of the mountain itself, rising 700 feet above the river, are beautiful. Nor is it possible to overlook in the varied and extensive prospect the vast Victoria Bridge, striding across the river and connecting the city and Lower Canada with the New England States and New York—a connection which formerly was carried on by Lake Champlain and the Hudson. The name of the city as at present written shows a curtailment as well as a corruption of its original one, the full name having been La Ville Marie de Mont Real. But the pronunciation of the name emphasizes the corruption, for the last syllable must be broadened out (as weall know) to “all”—Montreall!","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 21-2.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,Canada,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Ottawa,"Ottawa, Ontario",45.4183,-75.7009,John James Aubertin,1886,"As, when I realized Montreal, I wondered why that city had not been chosen as the seat of government, so, when I realized Ottawa, I wondered how and why it had been. High in the air, in the distance, I first caught sight of the elaborate and pretentious Government Buildings,: and presently came to compare with their somewhat garish style and highly finished precincts the strangely opposite aspect of the city below and around them. Ottawa is vulgarly called “Slab Town,” and, disavowing for my own part the slightest possible of sneers which the name might be thought to convey, I cannot pretend to wonder at its application. Was there ever such an overwhelming labyrinth of heaps and stacks of lumber—that is, timber sawn for use—to be found anywhere else? And if you wish to view a scene of sawing industries that produce all this profusion, go to the Chaudiére, or Caldron Falls, and behold and hear the army of saws that are set in motion by the impatient waters of the Ottawa river, here narrowed by islands to a width of stone two hundred feet, and rushing down for some forty feet over the brows of a rugged slope of rock. This busy, noisy scene of saw and water is sufficiently impressive both to eye and ear, but all the natural wild and boisterous beauty of the Rapids is completely suffocated by the practical uses they are put to. In this point of view, the scene reminded me of Trollhättan Falls, on the river Gotha, Sweden, the wild beauties of which are likewise entirely spoiled by the invasion of the surrounding saw-mills.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 32.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,Canada,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.8793,-87.6286,John James Aubertin,1886,"That is a well-known name, and here is the well-known city that owns it. Samuel Rogers, in that somewhat faint but pretty book of his called “Italy,” says that when he waked in Rome he said to himself, “I am at Rome!” Let me be supposed to have said, “I am at Chicago!” The difference, I will confess, is very great, the sentiments aroused very opposite. But in this case Chicago may serve as a foil to the word “Rome,” and thus be all the more vividly shown forth for what it really is. A raw, crowded, noisy, daring, busy, bustling, thriving young republican city, affording a splendid scene and flourish of trumpets for the first drawing up of the curtain of a visit to the States. In this respect it is far more to the purpose than New York, which is upon the sea and at the very doorway of the country; whereas Chicago is some thousand miles inland from that city...As to the teeming city itself, it is in some places scarcely less perplexing than the Board of Trade, and I must leave it to describe itself by its well-known name: it is Chicago. You may readily traverse it, for there is an extensive construction of the endless cable tramway system, the steel rope being in constant movement, and the cars being moved or stopped by clipping or unclipping connection with the chain underneath, in the centre of the road, and running in an open groove. A very large post-office—all in movement, of course—holds its place in the city; and there are wide streets and narrow streets, and large buildings and small buildings; and (while I was there) every sort of advertisement, including, very ostentatiously, those of rival railway companies, competing one against the other at incredibly cheap fares for great distances, such as some of us may remember, but on a somewhat smaller scale, in the early days of our own English railway system. Chicago appears to deal in the superlative in all matters. Some fifty years ago, it was only a small Indian town. Going as far back as 1830, the report I have referred to gives its population as only 70. In 1850, it was 29,963. In 1885, it was estimated at 727,000. And this, in spite of two conflagrations: that of 1871 one of the most destructive on record anywhere. Its grain elevators and depôts are marvels. The water-works have been called one of the wonders of the world, and its parks are of magnificent extent. They are ten in number, and contain altogether more than 2000 acres, with many miles of carriage drives, besides those along the extensive boulevards. It claims to be the third manufacturing city in the States; stands next to New York in general commercial importance; and to be the greatest grain, live-stock, and lumber market in the world. Yet, says the report, “considering what must be the development of the vast States and Territories, not yet really populated, which must depend on Chicago for the outlet of their produce, we must stand amazed at the future which is spread out before this favoured city situated at the head of a mighty chain of inland seas a highway along which to distribute the multiform products of an immense region, and by which in return to supply the varied wants of an increasing civilisation.” Already twenty-six railways converge in the city.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 55-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,United States of America,Noth Eastern Noth America,North America
Minneapolis,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",44.9771,-93.2666,John James Aubertin,1886,"In speaking of St. Paul, I must combine with it Minneapolis, at a few miles distant, both being in the State of Minnesota; the former its capital city, and both rival and rapidly advancing cities, at rather more than fourteen hundred miles from New York. The rapidity of the growth of these two cities, as officially reported, seems incredible. In 1860, the total population of the two was but 16,222; in 1884, it had grown to little short of 200,000; when I was there, each was claiming 150,000. There are only ten miles between them, and, in spite of their rivalry, a junction is predicted of the two into one. Anything in the shape of development appears to be possible in the States. The Americans have not only introduced new modes of spelling words, but they have given them a new meaning, and a very extended one in this instance. Nature, in the States, has permitted the junction of two elements which she has been justly charged with denying in other regions: a strong race with a strong land. Here she can give all she is properly asked for, and she is tolerably sure of being asked for everything she has to give. That by-and-by she will have a great many more to give to than she has now on her hands out here is a matter which must be left to the future to take care of. Both cities are on the Mississippi, which, in Indian language, signifies “The Father of Waters;” but it struck me that Minneapolis is the better placed of the two, because it can make more use of the mighty river than St. Paul can. I allude to the water-power at what are called the Falls of St. Anthony. It is round these falls that are constructed the gigantic flour-mills of Messrs. Pilsbury, which form the chief sight at Minneapolis, and where again figures of millions are put forward. In 1879, the millers there manipulated 7,514,364 bushels of wheat; and in 1885, the returns gave 32,112,840. Another calculation for 1885 is that the mills together are capable of delivering 33,973 barrels (of 60 lb.) per day; an amount said to be equal to the day's necessities of one-half of the population of Great Britain.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 74-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,United States of America,Western North America,North America
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",44.4185,-110.573,John James Aubertin,1886,"The enormous extent of the white formation, and the grouping of the projections whence the geysers from time to time play, must be unique in the world. All lies in front of the hotel, and it involves a very long walk to visit all the surface. The geysers, large and small, extending over this (so to speak) white territory, are said to be fifty in number; the large ones bear the several curious names of Old Faithful, the Bee-Hive, Castle, Splendid, Grand, Giantess, Giant, Lion, Lioness and Cubs, etc., etc. But herein. lies the great disappointment and drawback: they never go off altogether except in a picture. You may even lose days to see nothing but: the ridiculously named “Old Faithful;” and thus the impression of this visit to what we are told is the “grandest country, spectacularly, God Almighty has made,” and that it is “the Supreme Builder's own design and completion,” turns out disappointing. For our own part, we were not over-fortunate; Old Faithful, of course, we saw, for he goes off every seventy minutes or so, and is scarcely five minutes from the hotel. He is the mainstay of the visit, and yet, if you want to see the others, he at last begins to be almost a sort of nuisance. For ourselves, the first thing we heard on our arrival was that the Castle had just gone off, “about an hour ago,” and that the Grand had played “yesterday.” On the Saturday morning we were told that the Grand and the Giant had both been playing in the night; while the Beehive was disappointing everybody, as it had never been quiet for so long an interval. All that was accorded to us was a sudden call at supper on this last day, when some one came rushing in to say the large Cub had begun, and that the little one and the Lioness were sure to follow. And so they did; but the Lioness gave little more than a growl and lay down again, while the Cubs only behaved like cubs.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 89-90.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,United States of America,Western North America,North America
Calgari,"Calgary, Alberta",51.041,-114.0268,John James Aubertin,1886,"And now, if Calgari by-and-by becomes a large city, I shall be able to say (if still alive) that I saw it in its very beginnings. I have certainly seen, in reality, a city trying to begin, and already the hotel, only partly built, is called “The Royal.” There is also a newspaper, and there are stores. Plenty of the well-known corrugated iron is converted into use, if not beauty. I verily believe, from all I could gather, that this spot, situated as it is in the northwest of Canada, with almost unbounded capacities for corn and cattle around, is destined to become the focus of an immense thriving population. The grazing lands are spoken of as embracing four thousand square miles. Cattle already abound. The beef I ate from the rude kitchen was excellent. Americans are coming in to secure land, and on the very day I was there one of them arrived for the purpose of “locating” five hundred
 horses. They have not yet any great building which they call their Law Courts, and if they
 cannot have anything better than the cumbrous and inconvenient lump of ugliness that
 now adorns the neighbourhood of our Temple Bar, God forbid they ever should have!","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 117.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,Canada,Western North America,North America
Portland,"Portland, Oregon",45.5519,-122.6353,John James Aubertin,1886,"At about twelve miles above the confluence with the Columbia, on the west bank, Portland is finely situated, and no other city can more vividly exemplify the effects of railway development. In the year 1870 it contained a population of only 1100; by 1880, as a result of the construction of the eastern section of the Northern Pacific line, and the approaching completion of the great transcontinental system, the number had increased to 23,000. But in 1883 the population was given as nearly 40,000. Although one hundred miles from the coast, Portland is virtually a seaport, and vessels of 3000 tons may be seen loading at its wharfs; and in the busy season a perfect fleet of merchantmen is employed in shipping the great wheat crop of Oregon to Europe. The trade in tinned salmon from the Columbia is also very large; but, considering the immense destruction that is going on amidst the almost fabulous abundance of this fish in all these western waters, it seems possible that this item of commerce may not be continuously so extensive. Its position is attractive and picturesque. “It is a novel experience,” writes Mr. Fee in his pamphlet, from which some of these particulars are taken, “to stand in the primæval forest which hugs the city closely on all sides, and look down upon the bustling activity of trade and pleasure. Here are the tall pines and the dark thicket; there the masts, the smoky chimneys, and the dusty streets.” From Robinson's Hill the view comprises the rivers and all the five mountains: Mounts Jefferson and Hood, in Oregon, and, to the north, Mounts Adams and St. Helen's, with Tacoma at a greater distance. There are many resident thriving merchants, whose villas bespeak their wealth and adorn the suburbs. The climate is commendable as partaking of the softness of the Pacific, in contrast with the harshness of the Atlantic Ocean; and it is customary to compare the two Portlands in this respect. Portland in Maine is of rather a lower latitude than Portland in Oregon, the former standing at about 43° north, and the latter at about 46°. But the difference between the two climates, in favour of the latter, is so marked, and was so often mentioned to me, that I offered the following distich:— While Portland, Maine, lies wrapt in snow, In Portland, Oregon, the roses blow.","John James Aubertin, A Fight with Distances: The States, The Hawaiian Islands, Canada, British Columbia, Cuba, The Bahamas (London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1888), 125-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,United States of America,Western North America,North America
Delhi,Delhi,28.6517178,77.2219388,Alexander Burnes,1832,"In the end of December, 1831, I had the honour to obtain the final sanction of the Governor-general of India to proceed to Central Asia. I received my passports from his lordship at Delhi on the 23rd of that month, and proceeded by express to Lodiana on the frontiers, where I had the pleasure of meeting my fellow-traveller Mr. James Gerard, of the Bengal army. We here experienced many acts of kindness and assistance from Capt. C. M. Wade, the political agent, whose good offices I have to acknowledge with gratitude. The society of this, the most remote station of British India, also evinced an interest in our welfare which was truly gratifying. We took leave of it at a convivial party given for the occasion on the 2d of January, and on the following day bade a long farewell to such scenes, and plunged into the solitude of an Indian desert.We took the route that leads along the left bank of the Sutlege, till that river is joined by the Beas or Hyphasis.","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), 2.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,India,Southern Asia,Asia
Lodiana,Ludhiana,28.12791,76.67864,Alexander Burnes,1832,"In the upper parts of the Sutlege, near Lodiana, the inhabitants are exclusively agricultural; but, after that river has been joined by the Beas or Hyphasis, the habits of the people are predatory. There they are known under the various denominations of Dogur, Julmairee, Salairee, &c. and by the general designation of Raat, and live in a perpetual state of opposition to one another. In the cultivated parts this country has the appearance of an extensive meadow. It is entirely free from underwood, and some of the wheat fields extend for miles without a hedge. The grain is raised without irrigation, though the water is but twenty-six feet from the surface. There are no trees except in the vicinity of the villages; and such is the scarcity of fuel, that cow dung is universally used in its stead. This is dried and stacked. The fire formed of it throws out a most powerful heat, which leaves the people no cause to regret the want of other fuel. The country below that stripe which fringes the river is known by the name of Malwa. It has a dry climate and soil, and produces gram and barley, with bajree and mut, which are exported to the Punjab.","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), .",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,India,Southern Asia,Asia
Manja,Manja,30.2930623,76.095289,Alexander Burnes,1832,"On the following morning we commenced our march across the “Doab,” between the Beas and Ravee (Hydraotes), which has the name of Manja. It is the highest portion of the Punjab east of the Hydaspes; a fact which is established by the eastern bank of the one river as well as the western one of the other being both elevated. The left bank of the Ravee is about forty feet high, and so is the right bank of the Beas. The wells are also much deeper than south of the Sutlege; here they exceed sixty feet, there they are not twenty-six. The soil is a hard, indurated clay, sometimes gravelly, producing thorny shrubs and brambles, called by the natives jund, khureel, and baboolCultivation depends upon the rain, and irrigation is by no means general. Herds of neelgaee roam over it. Ancient canals.In former years the Mogul emperors, seeing the comparative sterility of this tract, fertilised it by canals from the Ravee, which connected that river with the Beas. The remains of one of them may be yet traced at the town of Puttee, running down at right angles upon the Beas, though it has been choked up for the last 150 years. The district of Manja is celebrated for the bravery of its soldiers, and the breed of its horses, which would always entitle it to the patronage of a sovereign.","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), 10.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,India,Southern Asia,Asia

The Chevalier came in his carriage drawn by four mules, into which the Dr. and myself stepped, and drove to his hospitable mansion, where we alighted and took up our quarters. After the ceremony of receiving various friendly and formal messages from Runjeet, the native part of the deputation withdrew, leaving a profusion of the fruits of Cashmeer and Cabool as an earnest of the condescension of their master.

Kote,Kot,34.4931,71.7178,Alexander Burnes,1832,"Half-way across to the Chenab, we halted in a garden at Kote, the residence of one of Runjeet Sing’s colonels. It was an agreeable halting-place. It was not 100 yards square, but well stored with fruit-trees and flowers: most of the former were now in blossom, and an enumeration of them would give a favourable idea of this climate. They consisted of the peach, apricot, greengage, fig, pomegranate, quince, orange sweet and bitter, lime, lemon, guava, grape, mango, jamboo, bair, date, cardamom, almond, and the apple; with seven or eight other kinds,[42] of which I can only give the native names,—the gooler, sohaujna, goolcheen, umltass, bell, bussoora. The walks of the garden were lined with beautiful cypresses and weeping willows; and in the flower-beds were the narcissus, and rose-bushes of the “sidburg,” or an hundred leaves. Most of the trees and flowers are indigenous, but many had been introduced from Cashmeer; and a native of that valley was the gardener. The proprietor of this pleasant spot was absent: his villa was in disorder, and much neglected, since he is suffering from the avarice of his ruler. His son, a sharp boy of nine years old, paid us a visit, and repeated some lines of a Persian poet which he was reading at school.

It stands on a spacious plain for the exercise of his troops. The name of the place has been altered from Russool to Ramnuggur since the Mahommedan supremacy has been overthrown. The one name signifies the city of the prophet, the other the city of a god; nor is it remarkable that the name of the Deity should prevail.The “Doab,” between the Ravee and Chenab, is a little better cultivated, and more fertile, than that which we had passed. Its soil is sandy, and in its centre the wells are but twenty-five feet deep. Their temperature averaged about 70° of Fahrenheit. In the morning, vapour or clouds of smoke ascended from them, till the atmosphere was sufficiently heated to hide it. At this season the climate is cold and bleak, frequently rainy, and always cloudy. The wind generally blows from the north.

It consists of three small towns situated close to each other, and about four miles from the river. Its houses are like others in the Punjab; but their frameworks are made of cedar (deodar), which is floated down with the inundations of the river from the Hemilaya. The durability and fragrance of this wood recommend it for building of every description. We saw a cedar-tree lying on the banks of the Hydaspes, with a circumference of thirteen feet. On this river the Macedonians constructed the fleet by which they navigated the Indus; and it is a remarkable fact, that in none of the other Punjab rivers are such trees floated down, nor do there exist any where else such facilities for the construction of vessels","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), 50-52.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,Pakistan,Southern Asia,Asia
Keora,Khewra,32.6305,73.011,Alexander Burnes,1832,"At the village of Keora, five miles from Pind Dadun Khan, we examined one of the principal mines. It was situated near the outside of the range, in a valley, which was cut by a rivulet of salt water. It opened into the hill through the red clayey formation above mentioned, at a distance of about 200 feet from the base. We were conducted by a narrow gallery, sufficient to admit of one person passing another, for about 350 yards, of which fifty may be taken as actual descent. Here we entered a cavern of irregular dimensions, and about 100 feet high, excavated entirely in salt. The mineral is deposited in strata of the utmost regularity, occurring, like the external rock, in vertical layers. Some of them, however, subtend an angle of from twenty to thirty degrees, and have the same appearance as bricks that have been placed upon one another. None of the layers exceed a foot and a half in thickness, and each is distinctly separated from its neighbour by a deposit of argillaceous earth about an eighth of an inch thick, which lies like mortar between the strata. Some of the salt occurs in hexagonal crystals, but oftener in masses: the whole of it is tinged with red, varying from the slightest shade to the deepest hue; when pounded, the salt is white. The temperature of the cavern exceeded that of the open air by twenty degrees, where the thermometer stood at sixty-four (in February). The natives state that these mines are much colder in the hot season; but this only shows that they undergo little or no alteration, while the heat outside alters with the season. There was no moist feeling, which one might have expected in a salt mine","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), 53.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,Pakistan,Southern Asia,Asia

The salt range runs parallel with the river, and presents a perfect contrast of desolation to its fertile valley; for it has no vegetation. Villages.Many villages, however, are perched upon the outer hills, which rise over one another in a picturesque manner. Nor are they more remarkable for their romantic situation than their comfort. We halted at one of them, which was neat and well kept, and lodged in a room which was about sixteen feet long, and half that breadth. It had cupboards and shelves, while the magazines for grain, which are formed[57] of earth, answered the purposes of tables. The whole buildings, both inside and out, are plastered with a grey-coloured earth, which gives them a cleanly appearance; and since these villages stand on the declivity of the hills, the rain washes down all that is disagreeable with it.","Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, (London: John Murray, 1834), 57.",https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58074/58074-h/58074-h.htm,Pakistan,Southern Asia,Asia

It had been hidden from us by towering precipices. We approached its ponderous walls by a straggling path which time had chiselled in the rock, and soon reached its lofty gateway. The black hoary aspect of the fort, and the arid sterility of the surrounding rocks, inspired us with no favourable idea of the neighbourhood, which has been the resort of many a desperate band.

Ships sailing up to the town, which is built on the side of a hill to the water’s edge, enliven the scene not a little. The water is very deep and the navigation secure, so that ships of seven hundred tons may come up to the town; but these noble harbours on the coast of Ireland are only melancholy capabilities of commerce: it is languid and trifling.

When two bits of these basalts are rubbed together quick, they emit a considerable scent like burnt leather. The scenery of the Causeway, nor of the adjacent mountains, is very magnificent, though the cliffs are bold; but for a considerable distance there is a strong disposition in the rocks to run into pentagonal cylinders, and even at a bridge by Mr. Lesly’s is a rock in which the same disposition is plainly visible.

The day was glorious, and our passage perfect. The sunset was lovely, but still lovelier the dawn as we were passing up the Scheldt between two and three in the morning. The crescent moon, the stars, the first faint blush of the dawn reflected in the glassy river, the dark mass of clouds on the horizon, which sent forth flashes of lightning, and the graceful forms of the boats and sailing vessels, painted in jetblack on the reddish gold of the sky and water, made up an unforgettable picture.

 used to be Amalia's residence. Tiefurt was a favourite resort of ours, for the walk to it is a very pleasant one, and the Tiefurt park is a little paradise. The Ilm is seen here to the best advantage: it is clearer than at Weimar, and winds about gracefully among fine trees. One of the banks is a high steep declivity, which shows the trees in all their perfection. In autumn, when the yellow and scarlet were at their brightest, these banks were fairy-like in their beauty. It was here that Goethe and his Court friends got up the performance of "" Die Fischerin"" by torchlight.","George Eliot, The Writings of George Eliot: George Eliot’s Life as Related in Her Letters and Journals, ed.

Ettersburg,Ettersburg,51.03419,11.27884,George Eliot,1854,"About ten days after our arrival at Weimar, we made an excursion to Ettersburg, one of the Duke's summer residences, interesting to us beforehand as the scene of private theatricals and sprees in the Goethe days. We carried provisions with us and Keats's poems. The morning was one of the brightest and hottest that August ever bestowed, and it required some resolution to trudge along the shadeless chaussee, which formed the first two or three miles of our way. One compensating pleasure was the sight of the beautiful mountain-ashes in full berry which, alternately with cherry trees, border
 the road for a considerable distance. I felt a child's love for the bunches of coral standing out against the blue sky. The Schloss is a house of very moderate size, and no pretension of any kind. Two flights of steps lead up to the door, and the balustrades are ornamented with beautiful creepers. A tiny sort of piazza under the steps is ornamented with creepers too, and has pretty earthenware vases filled with plants hanging from the ceiling.
 We felt how much beauty might be procured at small expense in looking at these things. A beautiful walk through a beechwood took us to the Mooshütte, before which stands the beech whereon Goethe and his friends cut their names, and from which Goethe denounced Waldemar. We could recognize some of the initials.","George Eliot, The Writings of George Eliot: George Eliot’s Life as Related in Her Letters and Journals, ed. J. W. Cross, vol. 23, 25 vols.

We found the man who inhabits the simple wooden house, which used to be Carl August's hunting-box. He sent a man on with us to show us the way to the Kickel-hahn, which we at last reached — I with weary legs. There is a magnificent view of hills from this spot; but Goethe's tiny wooden house is now closely shut in by fir trees, and nothing can be seen from the windows. His room, which forms the upper floor of the house, is about ten or twelve feet square. It is now quite empty, but there is an interesting memorial of his presence in these wonderful lines, written by his own hand, near the window-frame —

 fur; and we, all fur-less as we were, pitied him, and were thankful that at least we were not feverish and ill, as he evidently was.

In each room there is the bust of the poet who is its presiding genius; and the walls of the Goethe and Schiller rooms are decorated with frescoes, representing scenes from their works. The Wieland room is decorated with arabesques only.

Very interesting it is to see his study, which is happily left in its original state. In his bedroom we saw his skull for the first time, and were amazed at the smallness of the intellectual region. There is an intensely interesting sketch of Schiller lying dead, which I saw for the first time in the study; but all pleasure in thinking of Schiller's portraits and bust is now destroyed to me by the conviction of their untruthfulness. Rauch told us that he had a miserable Stirne.

The entrance-hall is certainly rather imposing, with its statues in niches and broad staircase. The latter was made after his own design, and was an ""after-shine"" of Italian tastes. The pictures are wretched, the casts not much better — indeed, I remember nothing which seemed intrinsically worth looking at. The MS. of his ""Römische Elegien,""
 written by himself in the Italian character, is to be seen here; and one likes to look at it better than at most of the other things. G. had obtained permission from Frau v. Goethe to see the studio and Schlafzimmer, which are not open to the public, and here our feelings were deeply moved. We entered first a small room containing drawers and shelves devoted to his mineralogical collections. From these we passed into the study. It is rather a dark room, for there are only two small windows — German windows. A plain deal table stands in the middle, and near the chair, against this table, is a high basket, where, I was afterwards told, Goethe used to put his pocket-handkerchief. A long sort of writing-table and bookcase united stands against one wall. Here hangs the pin-cushion, just as he left it, with visiting-cards suspended on threads, and other trifles which greatness and death have made sacred. Against the opposite wall, where you enter the bedroom, there is a high writing-desk, on which stands a little statue of Napoleon in creamy glass. The bedroom is very small. By the side of the bed stands a stuffed armchair, where he used to sit and read while he drank his coffee in the morning.
 It was not until very late in his life that he adopted the luxury of an armchair. From the other side of the study one enters the library, which is fitted up in a very makeshift fashion, with rough deal shelves, and bits of paper, with Philosophy, History, etc., written on them to mark the classification of the books. Among such memorials one breathes deeply, and the tears rush to one's eyes. 
 There is one likeness of Goethe that is really startling and thrilling from the idea it gives one of perfect resemblance. It is painted on a cup, and is a tiny miniature, but the execution is so perfect that, on applying a magnifying glass, every minute stroke has as natural an appearance as the texture of a flower or the parts of an insect under the microscope.","George Eliot, The Writings of George Eliot: George Eliot’s Life as Related in Her Letters and Journals, ed.

 straight and uniform avenues of insignificant trees contrasted* very disadvantageously with the charming variety of our beloved park at Weimar. Still we now and then noticed a beautiful wintry effect, especially in the part most remote ""from the town, where the trees are finer and the arrangements more varied. One walk, which skirted the Thiergarten on the right-hand side coming from the town, we were particularly fond of, because it gave us on one side an open view, with water

There is no difference of opinion about the looks of such people. All the world is agreed either that they are pretty or ugly. So it is with Berlin. Every one tells you it is an uninteresting modern city, with broad, monotonous streets; and when you see it, you cannot for the life of you get up an emotion of surprise, or make a remark about the place which you have not heard before.
 The day after our arrival was Sunday, 6th November: the sun shone brightly, and we went to walk in the Linden, elbowing our way among the promeneurs endimanchés, who looked remarkably smart and handsome after the Thuringians. ...

 They were very happy months we spent at Berlin, in spite of the bitter cold which came on in January and lasted almost till we left. How we used to rejoice in the idea of our warm room and coffee as we battled our way from dinner against the wind and snow! Then came the delightful long evening, in which we read Shakespeare, Goethe, Heine, and Macaulay, with German Pfefferkuchen and Semmels at the end to complete the noctes cenoeque deûm.
 We used often to turn out for a little walk in the evening, when it was not too cold, to refresh ourselves by a little pure air as a change from the stove-heated room. Our favourite walk was along the Linden, in the broad road between the trees. We used to pace to old Fritz's monument, which loomed up dark and mysterious against the sky. Once or twice we went along the gaslighted walk towards Kroll's. One evening in our last week, we went on to the bridge leading to the Friedrichstadt, and there by moon- and gas-light saw the only bit of picturesqueness Berlin afforded us. The outline of the Schloss towards the water is very varied, and a light in one of the windows near the top of a tower was a happy accident. The row of houses on the other side of
 the water was shrouded in indistinctness, and no ugly object marred the scene.

It seemed only a mountain of mud standing up out of the dull mists of the sea. But as we bore down upon it the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture—a mass of green farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and mingled its upper outlines with the clouds. It was ribbed with sharp, steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there on the heights, rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements and castles; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight, that painted summit, and slope and glen, with bands of fire, and left belts of somber shade between.

"Horta, Azores","Horta, Azores",38.5348,28.63,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"We anchored in the open roadstead of Horta, half a mile from the shore. The town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear to their summits—not a foot of soil left idle. Every farm and every acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow there. These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.
 The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguese characteristics about it. But more of that anon. A swarm of swarthy, noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship’s sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of any country. We landed under the walls of a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders, which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it. The group on the pier was a rusty one—men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars. They trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. It was very flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation. Here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on. This hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is unfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a woman’s head is hidden away in it like the man’s who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. There is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote, as they call it—it is just a plain, ugly dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can’t go within eight points of the wind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all. The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

Gibraltar,Gibraltar,36.1408,5.3536,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the African one, “Ape’s Hill,” a grand old mountain with summit streaked with granite ledges, was in sight. The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar, was yet to come. The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head of navigation and the end of the world. The information the ancients didn’t have was very voluminous. Even the prophets wrote book after book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at the existence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they must have known it was there, I should think.
 In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by the sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar. There could not be two rocks like that in one kingdom.
 The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by 1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base. One side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the side of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep slant which an army would find very difficult to climb. At the foot of this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar—or rather the town occupies part of the slant. Everywhere—on hillside, in the precipice, by the sea, on the heights—everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad with masonry and bristling with guns. It makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it. It is pushed out into the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of a “gob” of mud on the end of a shingle. A few hundred yards of this flat ground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across the strip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of a mile, comes the “Neutral Ground,” a space two or three hundred yards wide, which is free to both parties.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

Let those who went up through Spain make the best of it—these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party well enough. We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present. Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time. Elsewhere we have found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but always with things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, and so the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force. We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign—foreign from top to bottom—foreign from center to circumference—foreign inside and outside and all around—nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness—nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! In Tangier we have found it. Here is not the slightest thing that ever we have seen save in pictures—and we always mistrusted the pictures before. We cannot anymore. The pictures used to seem exaggerations—they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality. But behold, they were not wild enough—they were not fanciful enough—they have not told half the story. Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save The Arabian Nights. Here are no white men visible, yet swarms of humanity are all about us. Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old. All the houses nearly are one-and two-story, made of thick walls of stone, plastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as a floor on top, no cornices, whitewashed all over—a crowded city of snowy tombs! And the doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; the floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated, many-colored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and broad bricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (of Jewish dwellings) save divans—what there is in Moorish ones no man may know; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter.

All is orderly and beautiful—every thing is charming to the eye. /We had such glimpses of the Rhone gliding along between its grassy banks; of cosy cottages buried in flowers and shrubbery; of quaint old red-tiled villages with mossy medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst; of wooded hills with ivy-grown towers and turrets of feudal castles projecting above the foliage; such glimpses of Paradise, it seemed to us, such visions of fabled fairyland! / We knew then what the poet meant when he sang of: “—thy cornfields green, and sunny vines, O pleasant land of France!” / And it is a pleasant land. No word describes it so felicitously as that one. They say there is no word for “home” in the French language. Well, considering that they have the article itself in such an attractive aspect, they ought to manage to get along without the word. Let us not waste too much pity on “homeless” France. I have observed that Frenchmen abroad seldom wholly give up the idea of going back to France some time or other. I am not surprised at it now.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

Notre Dame Cathedral,Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,48.853,2.3499,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame. We had heard of it before. It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are. We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment; it was like the pictures. We stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages. The Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris. These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew’s Massacre, and they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day—and they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins. I wish these old parties could speak. They could tell a tale worth the listening to. / They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago—remains of it are still preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100. The ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time, one would think. One portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times. It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest—he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans. Alas! Those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church. / The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars. They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential power—but precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again! And they did. / We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns. We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the Azores, but no nails. They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter. His noble effort cost him his life. He was shot dead. They showed us a cast of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it lodged. These people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics. Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

The Morgue,The Morgue in Paris,48.8549,2.3475,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret. We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody. / On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it—mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help. A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face. We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss. We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain. I half feared that the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred. Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look—people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

Pere la Chaise,Pere la Chaise in Paris,48.8615,2.3935,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"One of our pleasantest visits was to Pere la Chaise, the national burying-ground of France, the honored resting-place of some of her greatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious men and women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their own energy and their own genius. It is a solemn city of winding streets and of miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from out a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers. Not every city is so well peopled as this, or has so ample an area within its walls. Few palaces exist in any city that are so exquisite in design, so rich in art, so costly in material, so graceful, so beautiful. / We had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marble effigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at length upon the tombs, and the sensations invoked were startling and novel; the curious armor, the obsolete costumes, the placid faces, the hands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplication—it was a vision of gray antiquity. It seemed curious enough to be standing face to face, as it were, with old Dagobert I., and Clovis and Charlemagne, those vague, colossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a thousand years ago! I touched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but Dagobert was deader than the sixteen centuries that have passed over him, Clovis slept well after his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on dreaming of his paladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me. / The great names of Pere la Chaise impress one, too, but differently. There the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is, that this place is sacred to a nobler royalty—the royalty of heart and brain. Every faculty of mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupation which men engage in, seems represented by a famous name. The effect is a curious medley. / Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battle tragedy, are here, and so also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimic tragedy on the stage. The Abbe Sicard sleeps here—the first great teacher of the deaf and dumb—a man whose heart went out to every unfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service; and not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal Ney, whose stormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms. The man who originated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introduced the cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving countrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens and princes of Further India. Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace the astronomer, Larrey the surgeon, de Suze the advocate, are here, and with them are Talma, Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger; Moliere and Lafontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whose worthy labors are as familiar in the remote by-places of civilization as are the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marble vaults of St. Denis. / But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, there is one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by without stopping to examine. Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea of the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but not one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and its romantic occupants. This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise—a grave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written and sung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other in Christendom save only that of the Saviour. All visitors linger pensively about it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes of it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come there to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken lovers make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail and “grit” their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase the sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of immortelles and budding flowers. / Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb. Go when you will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles. Go when you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supply the deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections have miscarried.","Mark Train (Samuel L.

Versailles,Versailles,48.8014,2.1301,Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens),1869,"VERSAILLES! It is wonderfully beautiful! You gaze and stare and try to understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not the Garden of Eden—but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite dream. The scene thrills one like military music! A noble palace, stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed that it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies of an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over the ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from the promenade to lower grounds of the park—stairways that whole regiments might stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whose great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty; wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled all the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were carved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with miniature ships glassed in their surfaces. And every where—on the palace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the trees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues—hundreds and hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to the fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it could have lacked. / It was worth a pilgrimage to see. Everything is on so gigantic a scale. Nothing is small—nothing is cheap. The statues are all large; the palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are interminable. All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles are vast. I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and these dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be. I know now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it is in reality. I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now. He took a tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris. He kept 36,000 men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night. The wife of a nobleman of the time speaks of this as an “inconvenience,” but naively remarks that “it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of tranquillity we now enjoy.”","Mark Train (Samuel L.

 By whom this New Plymouth (situated, according to Captain Jones his computation, in 41 degrees and 48 minutes) is now presently inhabited, your Lordship and the honorable Company do know better than myself. For whom how favourably God’s providence in thought and in deed, quite besides any plot or design of theirs, hath wrought, especially in the beginning of their enterprise, is worthy to be observed. For when, as your Lordship knows, their voyage was intended for Virginia, being by letters from Sir Edwin Sandys and Mr. Deputy Ferrar recommended to Sir Yeardley (then Governor) that he should give them the best advice he could for trading in Hudson’s River, whether it were by contrariety of wind or by the backwardness of their master or pilot to make (as they thought it) too long a journey, they fell short both of the one and the other, arriving first at that stately harbour called Cape Cod, called by Indians “Pamet”; from whence in shallop the pilot, a more forward undertaker than performer, promised to bring them to be seated in a pleasant and fertile place called Anquam, situate within Cape Ann, about forty leagues from Plymouth. After some dangerous and almost incurable errors and mistakings, he stumbled by accident upon the harbour of Plymouth; where, after the planters had failed of their intention, and the pilot of his, it pleased Almighty God (who had better provided for them than their own hearts could imagine) to plant them on the seat of an old town which divers [years] before had been abandoned of the Indians. So they both quietly and justly sate down without either dispossessing any of the natives, or being resisted by them, and without shedding so much as one drop of blood. Which felicity of theirs is confirmed unto them even by the voices of the savages themselves, who generally do acknowledge not only the seat, but the whole seigniory thereto belonging, to be, and do themselves disclaim all title from it; so that the right of those planters to it is altogether unquestionable—a favor which, since the first discovery of America, God hath not vouchsafed, so far as ever I could learn, upon any Christian nation within that continent. Yet can it not be denied but that these of the Summer Islands are blessed with the same privilege according to the saying of St. Paul, “If the firstfruits be holy, the lump is also holy.”","John Pory, Emmanuel Altham, and Isaack de Rasières, Three Visitors to Early Plymouth; Letters About the Pilgrim Settlement in New England During Its First Seven Years, ed.

The other side of the same small river, according to conjecture, is about 20 to 23 leagues broad to the South River,[140] in the neighborhood of the Sancicans, in so far as I have been able to make it out from the mouths of the savages; but as they live in a state of constant enmity with those tribes, the paths across are but little used, wherefore I have not been able to learn the exact distance; so that when we wish to send letters overland, they (the natives) take their way across the bay, and have the letters carried forward by others, unless one amongst them may happen to be on friendly terms, and who might venture to go there.","John Pory, Emmanuel Altham, and Isaack de Rasières, Three Visitors to Early Plymouth; Letters About the Pilgrim Settlement in New England During Its First Seven Years, ed.

It is about seven leagues in circumference, full of trees, and in the middle rocky to the extent of about two leagues in circuit. The north side has good land in two places, where two farmers, each with four horses, would have enough to do without much clearing at first. The grass is good in the forest and valleys, but when made into hay is not so nutritious for the cattle as here,[141] in consequence of its wild state, but it yearly improves by cultivation. On the east side there rises a large level field, of from 70 to 80 morgens of land,[142] 68 through which runs a very fine fresh stream; so that that land can be plowed without much clearing. It appears to be good. The six farms, four of which lie along the River Hellgate,[143] stretching to the south side of the island, have at least 60 morgens of land ready to be sown with winter seed, which at the most will have been plowed eight times. But as the greater part must have some manure, inasmuch as it is so exhausted by the wild herbage, I am afraid that all will not be sown; and the more so, as the managers of the farms are hired men. The two hindermost farms, Nos. 1 and 2, are the best; the other farms have also good land, but not so much, and more sandy; so that they are best suited for rye and buckwheat.","John Pory, Emmanuel Altham, and Isaack de Rasières, Three Visitors to Early Plymouth; Letters About the Pilgrim Settlement in New England During Its First Seven Years, ed.

 [...]
 
 At the south side of the town there flows down a small river of fresh water, very rapid, but shallow, which takes its rise from several lakes in the land above, and there empties into the sea; where in April and the beginning of May, there come so many shad from the sea which want to ascend that river, that it is quite surprising. This river the English have shut in with planks, and in the middle with a little door, which slides up and down, and at the sides with trellice work, through which the water has its course, but which they can also close with slides.
 
 At the mouth they have constructed it with planks, like an eel-pot, with wings, where in the middle is also a sliding door, and with trellice work at the sides, so that between the two [dams] there is a square pool, into which the fish aforesaid come swimming in such shoals, in order to get up above, where they deposit their spawn, that at one tide there are 10,000 to 12,000 fish in it, which they shut off in the rear at the ebb, and close up the trellices above, so that no more water comes in; then the water runs out through the lower trellices, and they draw out the fish with baskets, each according to the land he cultivates, and carry them to it, depositing in each hill three or four fishes, and in these they plant their maize, which grows as luxuriantly therein as though it were the best manure in the world. And if they do not lay this fish therein, the maize will not grow, so that such is the nature of the soil.
 
 New Plymouth lies on the slope of a hill stretching east towards the sea-coast, with a broad street about a cannon shot of 800 feet long, leading down the hill; with a [street] crossing in the middle, northwards to the rivulet and southwards to the land. The houses are constructed of clapboards, with gardens also enclosed behind and at the sides with clapboards, so that their houses and courtyards are arranged in very good order, with a stockade against sudden attack; and at the ends of the streets there are three wooden gates. In the center, on the cross street, stands the Governor’s house, before which is a square stockade upon which four patereros are mounted, so as to enfilade the streets. Upon the hill they have a large square house, with a flat roof, built of thick sawn planks stayed with oak beams, upon the top of which they have six cannon, which shoot iron balls of four and five pounds, and command the surrounding country. The lower part they use for their church, where they preach on Sundays and the usual holidays. They assemble by beat of drum, each with his musket or firelock, in front of the captain’s door; they have their cloaks on, and place themselves in order, three abreast, and are led by a sergeant without beat of drum. Behind comes the Governor, in a long robe; beside him on the right hand, comes the preacher with his cloak on, and on the left hand, the captain with his side-arms and cloak on, and with a small cane in his hand; and so they march in good order, and each sets his arms down near him.

When everything was ready, he sailed from that port, with the knights who were to accompany him, on Saturday the 3rd day of the month of November in the year of our redemption 1543[2]. Navigating swiftly over the great ocean sea, he sailed on until he arrived at Gran Canaria. Here he took in fresh provisions and was joined by the Licentiate Cepeda, who was going out as a Judge. Leaving that island, the voyage{2} was continued until the ships arrived at Nombre de Dios three days after Epiphany in 1544. Here he remained for 15 or 16 days, at the end of which time he proceeded to the city of Panama with those who had accompanied him.","Pedro de Cieza de León, The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

The Viceroy found the Licentiate Pedro Ramirez de Quiñones, now Judge of the Confines, in Panama. He was taking the residencia of Dr Villalobos and the Licentiate Paez, who had been Judges of the Court established in that kingdom. Presently the Viceroy took the royal seal, and placed it in a box with the veneration which was its due, with several chapters of the Ordinances[3],{3} intending to carry out the orders literally. They required that all the men and women of Peru should be sent to their native homes at the cost of those who possessed them, it being the will of the King that they should be free, as his subjects and vassals[5]. Notwithstanding that the order was just and righteous, some of the Indians evaded it because they were married, others because they liked their masters and were tolerably instructed in the matters of our Holy Catholic Faith. Even of those who were ordered to depart many merely went to hide in secret places so as not to go whither they were sent, and others went to the churches, whence they were taken by order of the Viceroy, and put on board ships, where many died. So that very few returned to their native places, and those that did went back to the rites and idolatries they had formerly been accustomed to. There was thus no benefit derived from compliance with this ordinance. Some Spanish conquerors, who returned to Spain, had lived with Indian women for many years, and had children by them. These were to be sent to the native places of the mothers at the cost of their masters. If they disputed or complained they had to pay double for freight and passage. Some had small children and prayed that they might not be sent to die owing to having no mothers. These were ordered to pay a still larger sum.","Pedro de Cieza de León, The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans. Clements R.

He accomplished the journey and was publicly well received, but really, at the bottom of their hearts, every one was sorry to see him, because he brought the new laws. Finally he was received as Viceroy, and at once began to enforce the ordinances. He ordered a copy to be made of the grants of Indians within the boundaries of San Miguel, asking the Caciques how many they had given, and the Encomenderos how many they had received, according to which he assessed the tribute which had to be paid. He then gave the Indians to understand that his Majesty ordered that they were to be free, and to be treated as his vassals.
 
 The members of the municipality of that city, seeing how the Viceroy enforced the ordinances, entreated him not to do so at once, but to give time for the Emperor to be informed generally of the state of the kingdom that, in consideration of the great service performed for his Majesty, he might deign to show mercy and not to insist on the ordinances being enforced in their entirety. Although they supplicated in great sorrow, holding up their right hand in testimony that they would always serve the King with loyalty, their prayers availed nothing, nor the protests and representations they made. Further he presently superseded Diego Palomino because he had been Lieutenant to the Governor, and he gave complete liberty to the Indians, telling them not to give anything to the Spaniards unless they paid for it first, and to use weights and measures in their dealings.","Pedro de Cieza de León, The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

As I came last, I had occasion to see all that had taken place along the road. As the Viceroy is such a zealous and fervent servant of your Majesty, as soon as he jumped on shore in this port of Tumbez, he put in force the ordinances and new laws which your Majesty gave for these kingdoms. Presently he gave freedom to all the Indians held to service by the Spaniards in Tumbez, telling them that, being free, they could go where they chose and act for themselves freely and according to their wishes. As regards all other provisions in the ordinances, the Viceroy went on executing them in accordance with your Majesty’s orders. With this liberty given to the Indians, I saw that those who had been taught our holy catholic faith and knew it, and were baptized Christians, having returned to their chiefs and their homes as before, also went back to their old rites and customs. Of this all the land is a witness. I also saw that in the houses of Christians and in the tambos on the roads, where the Christian doctrine used to be taught every night, now there is no such custom because there is no one to teach, all having gone to their chiefs and their homes.","Juan Solano, ""Letter Of Friar Juan Solano, Bishop Of Cuzco to the King,"" The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

All the rest had gone with their parents to the old homes, to live under their old laws and in blindness. I saw the same thing all the way to the city of Lima. I could only weep to see the Christians returning to be Infidels. For I know it is your Majesty’s wish that the Indians should become Christians and be taught the holy catholic faith, and not that they should abandon it. The reception their chiefs{134} gave them was to sacrifice them because they were Christians and had served Christians. This was publicly stated on the roads. I am myself a witness as regards one chief, for I scolded him and he confessed that he had sacrificed a woman, and seeing this I could not but feel it much. For to have the Indians subject to our holy catholic faith, and gentle and domestic as regards our evangel and Christianity is not to deprive them of liberty, but rather to give them that liberty that Christus liberavit nos not to make them slaves. They should be treated non sicut servi sub lege sed sicut liberi sub gratia constituti.

When the news came to Cuzco that he would consider no supplication, the people rose against the person of the Viceroy, and took up arms, saying that they would come to protest against the new laws, and they chose Gonzalo Pizarro for their captain. The Viceroy, knowing this, began to collect troops. When I arrived I saw that the troops were disorderly. Presently the Viceroy ordered 150,000 castellanos, which Vaca de Castro had on board ship for despatch to your Majesty, to be landed. He spent it all on his troops for hosen, doublets and other clothes. But though he paid them well, he did not gain the good will of fifty, as was seen afterwards.

The people then entered the Viceroy’s house and arrested him without anyone being killed or wounded, or a drop of blood shed. It was all done so quietly that it appeared to me as if it had been arranged beforehand. It was either a miracle or I cannot understand it. It is beyond me that a Viceroy, having so many troops, should have been arrested and no one hurt.

Having done my best to protect the papers from wet, I came out and found the men on the yard and the sail being lowered. I shouted that it was not to be done, but no one wanted to hear me.

Each{176} one then began to brandish his arms, calling the Spaniards bearded cowards and thieves. Others said, “May we not kill this little bearded one, to avenge what his brethren have done to us.” I appeased them by saying it was true than when the Spaniards came they did much harm; but that now there was justice, that the people were favoured and had their liberty. They then asked me if I was one of those who came first, or whether I had arrived recently. I answered that it was seventeen years since I came from Spain, that in all times there were some good and some bad, and that now they deserved much honour for it seemed to me that they were good men. As to what others had done, the fault did not lie with me. I then gave them some drink, and I gave some of them needles, ornaments, knives, and other things, so we made friends. I then wrote to the Inca to say that I had entered his country, but had not yet come to where he was, and that in token of friendship I sent him two glass jars and two dozen buttons of green glass that looked like emeralds.","Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa, ""Narrative Of The Route And Journey Made By Diego Rodriguez From The City Of Cuzco To The Land Of War Of Manco Inca Who Was In The Andes In Insurrection Against The Service Of His Majesty, And Of The Affairs Touching Which He Treated With The Object Of Establishing Peace, As Well As To Induce The People To Receive The Evangelical Doctrine Of Our Lord Jesus Christ,"" in The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

Viticos,Vitcos,-13.0982,-72.93192,Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa,1568,"I set out on the 12th of May and went on to Viticos where the seven Spaniards killed the Inca, and their heads are exposed. The Indians told me that those Spaniards had killed him to raise the land, and that they determined to kill him while playing at la herradura. One Mendez[84] did it with four or five stabs behind until he killed him; and to Titu Cusi, the Inca who is now, they would have done the same, but he escaped down some rocks, which they showed me. They, however, succeeded in giving him a stab in the leg, the mark of which he afterwards showed me. If they had wanted to kill some Indians they could have done so, but their object was to kill the Inca. Then many Indians and captains assembled, who seized the Spaniards and killed them.
 
 On the 13th of May I sent two of my Indians to the Inca with some refreshments of raisins, figs, and other things. The Inca received them well, and gave them two baskets of earth nuts which they were to take to me, with a message that next day he would arrive, so that we should see each other soon, and that I need not travel further.
 
 On the 14th of May the Indians of Bambacona had made a large house on a strong height surrounded by entrenchments. Below were the houses of the inhabitants. The road by which he was to come was very clean and passed over a great plain. The three hundred Indians{179} with their lances, and others from the surrounding country, had made a great theatre for the Inca, of red clay. They were awaiting his arrival, and wished me to go out to meet him. They told me that the people of the village would wait on the plain, and that they would show me a place where they had brought two loads of straw, half a stone’s throw from the rest of the people. They told me to wait there, and see the entry of the Inca, and not to move until the Inca sent for me.","Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa, ""Narrative Of The Route And Journey Made By Diego Rodriguez From The City Of Cuzco To The Land Of War Of Manco Inca Who Was In The Andes In Insurrection Against The Service Of His Majesty, And Of The Affairs Touching Which He Treated With The Object Of Establishing Peace, As Well As To Induce The People To Receive The Evangelical Doctrine Of Our Lord Jesus Christ,"" in The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

bridge of Chuquichaca,Q’eswachaka Rope Bridge,-14.38125,-71.48398,Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa,1568,"On the 28th of May we set out for the bridge of Chuquichaca to meet the Judge who was coming. A garrison of 200 Indians was left in Arancalla and the rest went with us. We arrived on Saturday, the eve of the Trinity, at the bridge of Chuquichaca, where we received the news that the Judge Matienzo was at the bridge of Amaibamba with 30 Spaniards, 10 negroes, 20 arquebusiers and 150 Cañari Indians with their lances. Presently we received a letter from the Judge Matienzo in which he said that he had come with this escort, that the Inca should cross the river to see him, and that the Treasurer Merlo, a clergyman, two other Spaniards and I would be hostages for his safety. The Inca wished to comply, but the captains would not consent. The Inca then wrote to the Judge Matienzo proposing that he should come with all his company to the passage of the bridge, that his honour should pass over, and that he, the Inca, would send as hostages his governor and camp master, who would go to the other side. The Inca then detached 300 Indians to keep watch and ward. I said that the Judge Matienzo would not consent to this, not having a royal commission, but that he would cross with all his escort and that, in that open space which was large, the Inca and Judge could see each other and discuss what they desired. The Inca wrote a letter to that effect. Then there were prepared litters of silver and gold and much carving, and he had 25 alcabuçes brought out, which he distributed among those who knew. He said to me that, as I was his friend, he wanted to tell me a secret. He had had 300 cloaks and also breeches of dead people brought. Then he called an assembly, saying that those who brought those clothes{197} had been killed, and if the Spaniards intended to attack, each one would become a good soldier in defence of his lord.","Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa, ""Narrative Of The Route And Journey Made By Diego Rodriguez From The City Of Cuzco To The Land Of War Of Manco Inca Who Was In The Andes In Insurrection Against The Service Of His Majesty, And Of The Affairs Touching Which He Treated With The Object Of Establishing Peace, As Well As To Induce The People To Receive The Evangelical Doctrine Of Our Lord Jesus Christ,"" in The War of Quito by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and Inca Documents, trans.

Columbus,"Columbus, Ohio",39.9607,-82.9973,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"I crossed Delaware county into Franklin county, where Columbus, the capital of the state, is situated. The roads from the lake to this city, with few exceptions, passed through woodlands, and the country is but thinly settled. Beech, oak, elm, hickory, walnut, whiteoak, ash, &c. compose the bulk of the forest trees; and in the bottom lands, enormous sycamores are to be seen stretching their white arms almost to the very clouds. The land is of various denominations, but in general may be termed fertile. Columbus, the capital of Ohio, is seated on the Scioto river, which is navigable for keel and flat boats, and small craft, almost to its source; and by means of a portage of about four miles, to Sandusky river, which flows into lake Erie, a convenient communication is established between the lakes, and the great western waters. The town is well laid out. The streets are wide; and the court-house, town-hall, and public offices, are built of brick. There are some good taverns here, and the tables d'hôtes are well and abundantly supplied.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 56-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Cincinnati,"Cincinnati, Ohio",39.1054,-84.5167,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"Cincinnati is built on a bend of the Ohio river, which takes here a semicircular form, and runs nearly west; it afterwards flows in a more southerly direction. A complete chain of hills, sweeping from one point of the bend round to the other, encloses the city in a sort of amphitheatre. The houses are mostly brick, and the streets all paved. There are several spacious and handsome market houses, which on market days are stocked with all kinds of provisions—indeed I think the market of Cincinnati is very nearly the best supplied in the United States. There are many respectable public buildings here, such as a courthouse, theatre, bazaar, (built by Mrs. Trollope, but the speculation failed), and divers churches, in which you may see well-dressed women, and hear orthodox, heterodox, and every other species of doctrine, promulgated and enforced by strength of lungs, and length of argument, with pulpit-drum accompaniment, and all other requisites ad captandum vulgus. The city stands on two plains: one called the bottom, extends about 260 yards back from the river, and is three miles in length, from Deer Creek to Mill Creek; the other is fifty feet higher than the first, and is called the Hill; this extends back about a mile. The bottom is sixty-five feet above low water mark. In 1815 the population was estimated at 6000, and at present it is supposed to be upwards of 25,000 souls. By means of the Dayton canal, which runs from that town nearly parallel with the “Big Miami” river, a very extensive trade, for all kinds of produce, is established with the back country. Steamers are constantly arriving at, and departing from the wharf, on their passage up and down the river. This is one of the many examples to be met with in the western country, of towns springing into importance within the memory of comparatively young men—a log-house is still standing, which is shewn as the first habitation built by the backwoodsman, who squatted in the forest where now stands a handsome and flourishing city.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 64-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Saint Louis,"Saint Louis, Missouri",38.625,-90.1956,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"St. Louis is built on a bluff bank. The principal streets rise one above the other, running parallel with the river; the houses are mostly built of stone, the bank being entirely composed of that material, the walls whitewashed, and the roofs covered with tin: from the opposite side it presents a very gay appearance. The ascent from the water's edge to the back of the town is considerable, but regular. The streets intersect each other at right angles, as do those of most American towns. They are much too narrow, having been laid down and built on from a plan designed by the Spanish commandant, previous to the Missouri territory becoming part of the United States. The population is estimated at six thousand, composed of Creole-French, Irish, and Americans. St. Louis must, at some future period, become decidedly the most important town in the western country, from its local and relative situation. It is seated on the most favourable point below the mouths of two noble rivers, the Missouri and the Illinois, having at its back an immense tract of fertile country, and open and easy communication Eighteen miles below the mouth of the Missouri, and thirty-six below that of the Illinois. with the finest parts of the western and north-western territories. These advantages, added to the constant and uninterrupted intercourse which it enjoys with the southern ports, must ultimately make St. Louis a town of wealth and magnitude.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 122-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Louisville,"Louisville, Kentucky",38.2469,-85.7571,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"Louisville is the chief town of Jefferson county, in Kentucky, and at present it is estimated to contain about 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves and free people of colour. The storekeepers here are more wealthy than those of Cincinnati, and their manners less disagreeable. The inhabitants of the latter town being mostly from the New England states, have in their dealings and manners that dry shrewdness which is the true Yankee characteristic. There are also located in Cincinnati some Irish pedlars, who have by all manner of means acquired wealth, and are now the “biggest bugs” in the place. A “big bug,” is a great man, in the phraseology of the western country. The public buildings of Louisville are few, and the streets are laid out in the usual style, crossing each other at right angles. It contains a few good brick dwelling-houses, and a number of excellent hack-carriages are stationed near the steam-boat landing. A canal round the Falls, from Beargrass-creek to Shippingsport, is being constructed, which will enable steam-boats of the largest tonnage to pass through; and thus it will open an uninterrupted intercourse between the Upper and Lower Ohio, and the Mississippi. The length of this canal is about two and a half miles, and the original estimate was 200,000 dollars, but this sum has been found insufficient.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 178-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
New Orleans,"New Orleans, Louisana",29.9389,-90.096,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"New Orleans is seated on the south-east bank of the Mississippi; and, following the sinuosities of the current, about 109 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. The river takes here a right-angular sweep, and the city proper is built on the exterior point of the bend, the fauxbourgs extending at each side along the banks. At high water the river rises three feet above any part of the city; consequently, were it not for leveés that have been constructed here, and also along the banks of the river for more than a hundred miles, at both sides, above and below, the whole country would be periodically inundated. The fall from the levée to Bayou St. John, which communicates with Lac Pontchartrain , is about thirty feet, and the distance one mile. This fall is certainly inconsiderable; but I apprehend that it would be sufficient to drain the streets effectually, if proper attention were directed to that object. The city extends only half-a-mile back, and, including the fauxbourgs , about two miles along the river. The streets, being only partially paved, can never be perfectly cleaned, and stagnant water remains in the kennels at all seasons; this and the exhalations from the swamps in warm weather, produce that pestilential scourge with which the place is annually afflicted. The mortality here last season (the autumn of 1829) has been variously stated in the public prints at from five to seven thousand, who died of the yellow fever in the space of about ten weeks. This statement, however, is erroneous; as, from information which I received from the sexton of the American grave-yard, and from the number of fresh graves which I saw there, I am inclined to think that the total amount falls short of 2500, out of a resident population of less than 40,000 souls. About 700 were buried in the American grave-yard, and perhaps double that number in that of the French. The port of New Orleans presents the most extraordinary medley of any port in the world. Craft of every possible variety may be seen moored along the leveés, and the markets and adjacent streets crowded with people of almost every nation in Europe, Africa, and America, who create a frightful confusion of tongues. A particular part of the quay is appropriated to each description of craft, and a penalty is enforced for any deviation from port regulations. The upper part is occupied with flat-boats, arks, peeroges, rafts, keelboats, canoes, and steam-boats; and below these are stationed schooners, cutters, brigs, ships, &c., in regular succession. The levée is almost constantly filled with merchandize; and the scene of bustle and confusion which is exhibited here during the early part of the day, fully proves the large amount of commercial intercourse which this city enjoys.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 188-191.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Baltimore,"Baltimore, Maryland",39.2881,-76.6187,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"Baltimore is seated on the north side of the Patapsco river, within a few miles of the Chesapeak bay. It received its name in compliment to the Irish family of the Calverts. The harbour, at Fell Point, has about eighteen feet water, and is defended by a strong fort, called Mc Henry's fort, on Observation Hill. Vessels of large tonnage cannot enter the basin. In 1791 it contained 13,503 inhabitants; in 1810, 46,487; and at present it contains 80,519. There are many fine buildings and monuments in this city; and the streets in which business is not extensively transacted, are planted with Lombardy poplar, locust, and pride-of-china trees,—the last mentioned especially afford a fine shade. A considerable schooner trade is carried on by the merchants of Baltimore with South America. The schooners of this port are celebrated for their beauty, and are much superior to those of any other port on the Continent. They are sharp built, somewhat resembling the small Greek craft one sees in the Mediterranean. A rail-road is being constructed from this place to the Ohio river, a distance of upwards of three hundred miles, and about fourteen miles of the road is already completed, as is also a viaduct. If the enterprising inhabitants of Baltimore be able to finish this undertaking, it must necessarily throw a very large amount of wealth into their hands, to the prejudice of Philadelphia and New York. But the expense will be enormous.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 305-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",39.9427,-75.1575,Simon Ansley Ferrall,1832,"Philadelphia is a regular well-built city, and one of the handsomest in the states. It lies in latitude 39°56 north, and longitude, west of London, 75°8; distant from the sea, 120 miles. The city stands on an elevated piece of ground between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers, about a mile broad from bank to bank, and six miles from their junction. The Delaware is about a mile wide at Philadelphia, and ships of the largest tonnage can approach the wharf. The city contains many fine buildings of Schuylkill marble. The streets are well paved, and have broad trottoirs of hard red brick. The police regulations are excellent, and cleanliness is much attended to, the kennels being washed daily during the summer months, with water from the reservoirs. The markets, or shambles, extend half-amile in length, from the wharf up Market-street, in six divisions. In addition to the shambles, farmers' waggons, loaded 311 with every kind of country produce for sale, line the street. There are five banking establishments in the city: the Bank of North America, the United States Bank, the Bank of Pennsylvania, the Bank of Philadelphia, and the Farmers' Bank. The principal institutions are, the Franklin library, which contains upwards of 20,000 volumes. Strangers are admitted gratis, and are permitted to peruse any of the books. The Americans should adopt this practice in all their national exhibitions, and rather copy the liberality of the French than the sordid churlishness of the English, who compel foreigners to pay even for seeing the property of the nation. The other institutions are, the University of Pennsylvania, a College, Medical Theatre, College of Physicians, Philosophical Hall, Agricultural and Linnean Societies, Academy of Fine Arts, and the Cincinnati Society, which originated in an attempt to establish a sort of aristocracy. The members were at its formation the surviving officers of the revolution; they wear an eagle, suspended by a ribbon, which, at their death, they have appointed to be taken by their eldest sons. There are besides, the Academies of the Philadelphian Friends, and the German Lutherans; Sunday and Lancasterian schools; and, of course, divers Bible and Tract Societies, which are patronized by all the antiquated dames in the city, and superintended by the Methodist and Presbyterian parsons. The Methodist parsons of this country have the character of being men of gallantry; and indeed, from the many instances I have heard of their propensity in this way, from young Americans, I should be a very sceptic to doubt the fact.","Simon Ansley Ferrall, A Ramble of Six Thousand Miles Through the United States of America (London: Effingham Wilson, 1832), 310-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00376/00376.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,"North America, Americas"
Paris,"Paris, France",48.8662,2.3246,William Cullen Bryant,1834,"But when we entered Paris, and passed the Barrière d'Etoile, with its lofty triumphal arch; when we swept through the arch of Neuilly, and came in front of the Hotel des Invalides, where the aged or maimed soldiers, the living monuments of so many battles, were walking or sitting under the elms of its broad esplanade; when we saw the colossal statues of statesmen and warriors frowning from their pedestals on the bridges which bestride the muddy and narrow channel of the Seine; when we came in sight of the gray pinnacles of the Tuilleries, and the Gothic towers of Notre-Dame, and the Roman ones of St. Sulpice, and the dome of the Pantheon, under which lie the remains of so many of the great men of France, and the dark column of Place Vendôme, wrought with figures in relief, and the obelisk brought from Egypt to ornament the Place Louis Quatorze, the associations with antiquity which the country presents, from being general, became particular and historical. They were recollections of power, and magnificence, and extended empire; of valor and skill in war which had held the world in fear; of dynasties that had risen and passed away; of battles and victories which had left no other fruits than their monuments.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Marseille,"Marseille, France",43.2958,5.3763,William Cullen Bryant,1834,"Marseilles is seated in the midst of a semicircle of mountains of whitish rock, the steep and naked sides of which scarce afford “a footing for the goat.” Stretching into the Mediterranean they inclose a commodious harbor, in front of which are two or three rocky islands anchored in a sea of more vivid blue than any water I had ever before seen. The country immediately surrounding the city is an and and dusty valley, intersected here and there with the bed of a brook or torrent, dry during the summer. It is carefully cultivated, however, and planted with vineyards, and orchards of olive, fig, and pomegranate trees. The trees being small and low, the foliage of the olive thin and pale, the leaves of the fig broad and few, and the soil appearing everywhere at their roots, as well as between the rows of vines, the vegetation, when viewed from a little distance, has a meagre and ragged appearance. The whiteness of the hills, which the eye can hardly bear to rest upon at noon, the intense blue of the sea, the peculiar forms of the foliage, and the deficiency of shade and verdure, made me almost fancy myself in a tropical region. The Greeks judged well of the commercial advantages of Marseilles when they made it the seat of one of their early colonies. I found its streets animated with a bustle which I had not seen since I left New York, and its port thronged with vessels from all the nations whose coasts border upon the great midland sea of Europe. Marseilles is the most flourishing seaport in France; it has already become to the Mediterranean what New York is to the United States, and its trade is regularly increasing. The old town is ugly, but the lower or new part is nobly built of the light-colored stone so commonly used in France, and so easily wrought—with broad streets and, what is rare in French towns, convenient sidewalks. New streets are laid out, gardens are converted into building-lots, the process of levelling hills and filling up hollows is going on as in New York, the city is extending itself on every side, and large fortunes have been made by the rise in the value of landed property.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Venice,"Venice, Italy",45.4381,12.3302,William Cullen Bryant,1835,"Since my last letter I have visited Venice, a city which realizes the old mythological fable of beauty born of the sea. I must confess, however, that my first feeling on entering it was that of disappointment. As we passed in our gondola out of the lagoons, up one of the numerous canals, which permeate the city in every direction in such a manner that t seems as if you could only pass your time either within doors or in a boat, the place appeared to me a vast assemblage of prisons surrounded with their moats, and I thought how weary I should soon grow of my island prison, and how glad to escape again to the main-land. But this feeling quickly gave way to delight and admiration, when I landed and surveyed the clean though narrow streets, never incommoded by dust nor disturbed by the noise and jostling of carriages and horses, by which you may pass to every part of the city—when I looked again at the rows of superb buildings, with their marble steps ascending out of the water of the canals, in which the gondolas were shooting by each other—when I stood in the immense square of St. Mark, surrounded by palaces resting on arcades, under which the shops rival in splendor those of Paris, and crowds of the gay inhabitants of both sexes assemble towards evening and sit in groups before the doors of the coffee-houses—and when I gazed on the barbaric magnificence of the church of St. Mark and the Doge's palace, surrounded by the old emblems of the power of Venice, and overlooking the Adriatic, once the empire of the republic. The architecture of Venice has, to my eyes, something watery and oceanic in its aspect. Under the hands of Palladio, the Grecian orders seemed to borrow the lightness and airiness of the Gothic. As you look at the numerous windows and the multitude of columns which give a striated appearance to the fronts of the palaces, you think of stalactites and icicles, such as you might imagine to ornament the abodes of the water-gods and sea-nymphs. The only thing needed to complete the poetic illusion is transparency or brilliancy of color, and this is wholly wanting; for at Venice the whitest marble is soon clouded and blackened by the corrosion of the sea-air.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Richmond,"Richmond, Virginia",37.5459,-77.4538,William Cullen Bryant,1843,"A beautiful city is Richmond, seated on the hills that overlook the James River. The dwellings have a pleasant appearance, often standing by themselves in the midst of gardens, In front of several, I saw large magnolias, their dark, glazed leaves glittering in. the March sunshine. The river, as yellow as the Tiber, its waters now stained with the earth of the upper country, runs by the upper part of the town in noisy rapids, embracing several islands, shaded with the plane-tree, the hackberry, and the elm, and prolific, in spring and summer, of wild-flowers. I went upon one of these islands, by means of a footbridge, and was pointed to another, the resort of a quoit-club comprising some of the most distinguished men of Richmond, among whom in his lifetime was Judge Marshall, who sometimes joined in this athletic sport. We descended one of the hills on which the town is built, and went up another to the east, where stands an ancient house of religious worship, the oldest Episcopal church in the state. It is in the midst of a burying-ground, where sleep some of the founders of the colony, whose old graves are greenly overgrown with the trailing and matted periwinkle. In this church, Patrick Henry, at the commencement of the American Revolution, made that celebrated speech, which so vehemently moved all who heard him, ending with the sentence: “Give me liberty or give me death.” We looked in at one of the windows; it is a low, plain room, with small, square pews, and a sound ing board over the little pulpit. From the hill on which this church stands, you have a beautiful view of the surrounding country, a gently undulating surface, closed in by hills on the west; and the James River is seen wandering through it, by distant plantations, and between borders of trees. A place was pointed out to us, a little way down the river, which bears the name of Powhatan; and here, I was told, a flat rock is still shown as the one on which Captain Smith was placed by his captors, in order to be put to death, when the intercession of Pocahontas saved his life.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Charleston,"Charleston, South Carolina",32.7779,-79.9306,William Cullen Bryant,1843,"The next morning, at eight o'clock, we found ourselves entering Charleston harbor; Sullivan's Island, with Fort Moultrie, breathing recollections of the revolution, on our right; James Island on our left; in front, the stately dwellings of the town, and all around, on the land side, the horizon bounded by an apparent belt of evergreens—the live-oak, the wateroak, the palmetto, the pine, and, planted about the dwellings, the magnolia and the wild orange—giving to the scene a summer aspect. The city of Charleston strikes the visitor from the north most agreeably. He perceives at once that he is in a different climate. The spacious houses are surrounded with broad piazzas, often a piazza to each story, for the sake of shade and coolness, and each house generally stands by itself in a garden planted with trees and shrubs, many of which preserve their verdure through the winter. We saw early flowers already opening; the peach and plum-tree were in full bloom; and the wild orange, as they call the cherry-laurel, was just putting forth its blossoms. The buildings— some with stuccoed walls, some built of large dark-red bricks, and some of wood—are not kept fresh with paint like ours, but are allowed to become weather-stained by the humid climate, like those of the European towns. The streets are broad and quiet, unpaved in some parts, but in none, as with us, offensive both to sight and smell. The public buildings are numerous for the size of the city, and well-built in general, with sufficient space about them to give them a noble aspect, and all the advantage which they could derive from their architecture. The inhabitants, judging from what I have seen of them, which is not much, I confess, do not appear undeserving of the character which has been given them, of possessing the most polished and agreeable manners of all the American cities.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Savannah,"Savannah, Georgia",32.0658,-81.0936,William Cullen Bryant,1843,"Savannah is beautifully laid out; its broad streets are thickly planted with the Pride of India, and its frequent open squares shaded with trees of various kinds. Oglethorpe seems to have understood how a city should be built in a warm climate, and the people of the place are fond of reminding the stranger that the original plan of the founder has never been departed from. The town, so charmingly embowered, reminded me of New Haven, though the variety of trees is greater. In my walks about the place I passed a large stuccoed building of a dull-yellow color, with broad arched windows, and a stately portico, on each side of which stood a stiff-looking palmetto, as if keeping guard. The grim aspect of the building led me to ask what it was, and I was answered that it was “the old United States Bank.” It was the building in which the Savannah branch of that bank transacted business, and is now shut up until the time shall come when that great institution shall be revived. Meantime I was pained to see that there exists so little reverence for its memory, and so little gratitude for its benefits, that the boys have taken to smashing the windows, so that those who have the care of the building have been obliged to cover them with plank. In another part of the city I was shown an African church, a neat, spacious wooden building, railed in, and kept in excellent order, with a piazza extending along its entire front. It is one of the four places of worship for the blacks of the town, and was built by negro workmen with materials purchased by the contributions of the whites. South of the town extends an uninclosed space, on one side of which is a pleasant grove of pines, in the shade of which the members of a quoit-club practice their athletic sport. Here on a Saturday afternoon, for that is their stated time of assembling, I was introduced to some of the most distinguished citizens of Savannah, and witnessed the skill with which they threw the discus. No apprentices were they in the art; there was no striking far from the stake, no sending the discus rolling over the green; they heaped the quoits as snugly around the stakes as if the amusement had been their profession. In the same neighborhood, just without the town, lies the public cemetery surrounded by an ancient wall, built before the revolution, which in some places shows the marks of shot fired against it in the skirmishes of that period. I entered it, hoping to find some monuments of those who founded the city a hundred and ten years ago, but the inscriptions are of comparatively recent date. Most of them commemorate the death of persons born in Europe, or the northern states. I was told that the remains of the early inhabitants lie in the brick tombs, of which there are many without any inscription whatever.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

St. Augustine,"St. Augustine, Florida",29.8954,-81.3153,William Cullen Bryant,1843,"You can not be in St. Augustine a day without hearing some of its inhabitants speak of its agreeable climate. During the sixteen days of my residence here, the weather has certainly been as delightful as I could imagine. We have the temperature of early June, as June is known in New York. The mornings are sometimes a little sultry, but after two or three hours, a fresh breeze comes in from the sea, sweeping through the broad piazzas and breathing in at the windows. At this season it comes laden with the fragrance of the flowers of the Pride of India, and sometimes of the orange-tree, and sometimes brings the scent of roses, now in full bloom. The nights are gratefully cool, and I have been told, by a person who has lived here many years, that there are very few nights in the summer when you can sleep without a blanket.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Liverpool,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",53.4096,-2.9914,William Cullen Bryant,1845,"“Liverpool,” said one of its inhabitants to me, “is more like an American than an English city; it is new, bustling, and prosperous.” I saw some evidences of this after I had got my baggage through the custom-house, which was attended with considerable delay, the officers prying very closely into the contents of certain packages which I was taking for friends of mine to their friends in England, cutting the packthread, breaking the seals, and tearing the wrappers without mercy. I saw the streets crowded with huge drays, carrying merchandise to and, fro, and admired the solid construction of the docks, in which lay thousands of vessels from all parts of the globe. The walls of these docks are built of large blocks of red sandstone, with broad gateways opening to the river Mersey, and when the tide is at its height, which I believe is about thirty feet from low water, the gates are open, and vessels allowed to enter and depart. When the tide begins to retire, the gates are closed, and the water and the vessels locked in together. Along the river for miles, the banks are flanked with this massive masonry, which in some places I should judge to be nearly forty feet in height. Meantime the town is spread ing into the interior; new streets are opened; in one field you may see the brickmakers occupied in their calling, and in the opposite one the bricklayers building rows of houses. New churches and new public buildings of various kinds are going up in these neighborhoods. The streets which contain the shops have for the most part a gay and showy appearance; the buildings are generally of stucco, and show more of architectural decoration than in our cities. The greater part of the houses, however, are built of brick which has a rough surface, and soon acquires in this climate a dark color, giving a gloomy aspect to the streets. The public buildings, which are rather numerous, are of a drab-colored freestone, and those which have been built for forty or fifty years, the Town Hall, for example, and some of the churches, appear almost of a sooty hue.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Glasgow,"Glasgow, Scotland",55.8579,-4.2567,William Cullen Bryant,1845,"When we reached Glasgow on the 18th of July, the streets were swarming with people. I inquired the occasion, and was told that this was the annual fair. The artizans were all out with their families, and great numbers of country people were sauntering about. This fair was once, what its name imports, an annual market for the sale of merchandise; but it is now a mere holiday in which the principal sales, as it appeared to me, were of gingerbread and whisky. I strolled the next morning to the Green, a spacious open ground that stretches along the Clyde. One part of it was occupied with the booths and temporary theatres and wagons of showmen, around and among which a vast throng was assembled, who seemed to delight in being deafened with the cries of the showmen and the music of their instruments. In one place a band was playing, in another a gong was thundering, and from one of the balconies a fellow in regal robes and a pasteboard crown, surrounded by several persons of both sexes in tawdry stage-dresses, who seemed to have just got out of bed and were yawning and rubbing their eyes, was vociferating to the crowd in praise of the entertainment which was shortly to be offered them, while not far off the stentor of a rival company, under a flag which announced a new pantomime for a penny, was declaiming with equal vehemence. I made my way with difficulty through the crowd to the ancient street called the Salt Market, in which Scott places the habitation of Baillie Jarvie. It was obstructed with little stalls, where toys and other inconsiderable articles were sold. Here at the corner of one of the streets stands the old tower of the Tolbooth where Rob Roy was confined, a solid piece of ancient architecture. The main building has been removed and a modern house supplies its place; the tower has been pierced below for a thoroughfare, and its clock still reports the time of day to the people of Glasgow. The crowd through which I passed had that squalid appearance which marks extreme poverty and uncertain means of subsistence, and I was able to form some idea of the prodigious number of this class in a populous city of Great Britain like Glasgow. For populous she is, and prosperous as a city, increasing with a rapidity almost equal to that of New York, and already she numbers, it is estimated, three hundred thousand inhabitants. Of these it is said that full one-third are Irish by birth or born of Irish parents. The next day, which was Sunday, before going to church, I walked towards the west part of the city; where the streets are broad and the houses extremely well-built, of the same noble material as the new town of Edinburgh; and many of the dwellings have fine gardens. Their sites in many places overlook the pleasant valley of the Clyde, and I could not help acknowledging that Glasgow was not without claim to the epithet of beautiful, which I should have denied her if I had formed my judgment from the commercial streets only. The people of Glasgow also have shown their good sense in erecting the statues which adorn their public squares, only to men who have some just claim to distinction.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Rotterdam,"Rotterdam, Holland",51.9114,4.4782,William Cullen Bryant,1848,"We passed two nights in Antwerp, and then went down the Scheldt in a steamer, which, in ten hours, brought us to Rotterdam, sometimes crossing an arm of the sea, and sometimes threading a broad canal. The houses on each side of these channels, after we entered Holland, were for the most part freshly painted; the flat plains on each side protected by embankments, and streaked by long wide ditches full of water, and rows of pollard willows. Windmills by scores, some grinding corn, but most of them pumping water out of the meadows and pouring it into the channel, stood on the bank and were swinging their long arms madly in a high wind. On arriving at Rotterdam, you perceive at once that you are in Holland. The city has as many canals as streets, the canals are generally overhung with rows of elms, and the streets kept scrupulously clean with the water of the canals, which is salt. Every morning there is a vigorous splashing and mopping performed before every door by plump servant girls, in white caps and thick wooden shoes. Our hotel stood fronting a broad sheet of water like the lagoons at Venice, where a solid and straight stone wharf was shaded with a row of elms, and before our door lay several huge vessels fastened to the wharf, which looked as if they were sent thither to enjoy a vacation, for they were neither loading nor unloading, nor did any person appear to be busy about them. Rotterdam was at that time in the midst of a fair which filled the open squares and the wider streets of the city with booths, and attracted crowds of people from the country. There were damsels from North Holland, fair as snow, and some of them pretty, in long-eared lace caps, with their plump arms bare; and there were maidens from another province, the name of which I did not learn, equally good-looking, with arms as bare, and faces in white muslin caps drawn to a point on each cheek. Olycoeks were frying, and waffles baking in temporary kitchens on each side of the streets.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

Cleveland,"Cleveland, Ohio",41.4993,-81.6977,William Cullen Bryant,1846,"It is situated beyond a steep bank of the lake, nearly as elevated as the shore at Brooklyn, which we call Brooklyn Heights. As I stood on the edge of this bank and looked over the broad lake below me, stretching beyond the sight and quivering in the summer wind, I was reminded of the lines of Southey: —""Along the bending line of shore Such hue is thrown as when the peacock's neck Assumes its proudest tint of amethyst, Embathed in emerald glory."" But it was not only along the line of the shore that these hues prevailed; the whole lake glowed with soft amethystine and emerald tinges, in irregular masses, like the shades of watered silk. Cleveland stands in that beautiful country without a hill, of which my fellowpassenger spoke—a thriving village yet to grow into a proud city of the lake country. It is built upon broad dusty ways, in which not a pebble is seen in the fat dark earth of the lake shore, and which are shaded with locust-trees, the variety called seed-locust, with crowded twigs and clustered foliage—a tree chosen, doubtless, for its rapid growth, as the best means of getting up a shade at the shortest notice. Here and there were gardens filled with young fruit-trees; among the largest and hardiest in appearance was the peachtree, which here spreads broad and sturdy branches, escapes the diseases that make it a short-lived tree in the Atlantic states, and produces fruit of great size and richness. One of my fellow-passengers could hardly find adequate expressions to signify his high sense of the deliciousness of the Cleveland Peaches.","William Cullen Bryant, Letters of a Traveller; or, Notes of Things Seen in Europe and America (New York: George P.

They say that they are descended from the tribe of Ephraim. And in the midst of them is the grave of Joseph, the son of Jacob our father, as it is written—""and the bones of Joseph buried they in Shechem."" Their alphabet lacks three letters, namely . The letter He is taken from Abraham our father, because they have no dignity, the letter Heth from Isaac, because they have no kindliness, and the letter Ain from Jacob, because they have no humility. In place of these letters they make use of the Aleph, by which we can tell that they are not of the seed of Israel, although they know the law of Moses with the exception of these three letters. They guard themselves from the defilement of the dead, of the bones of the slain, and of graves; and they remove the garments which they have worn before they go to the place of worship, and they bathe and put on fresh clothes. This is their constant practice. On Mount Gerizim are fountains and gardens and plantations, but Mount Ebal is rocky and barren; and between them in the valley lies the city of Shechem.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

Bagdad,,33.31524,44.36606,Benjamin of Tudela,1160,"Thence it is two days to Bagdad, the great city and the royal residence of the Caliph Emir al Muminin al Abbasi of the family of Mohammed. He is at the head of the Mohammedan religion, and all the kings of Islam obey him; he occupies a similar position to that held by the Pope over the Christians. He has a palace in Bagdad three miles in extent, wherein is a great park with all varieties of trees, fruit-bearing and otherwise, and all manner of animals. The whole is surrounded by a wall, and in the park there is a lake whose waters are fed by the river Hiddekel. Whenever the king desires to indulge in recreation and to rejoice and feast, his servants catch all manner of' birds, game and fish, and he goes to his palace with his counsellors and princes. There the great king, Al Abbasi the Caliph (Hafiz) holds his court, and he is kind unto Israel, and many belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants; he knows all languages, and is well versed in the law of Israel. He reads and writes the holy language (Hebrew). He will not partake of anything unless he has earned it by the work of his own hands. He makes coverlets to which he attaches his seal; his courtiers sell them in the market, and the great ones of the land purchase them, and the proceeds thereof provide his sustenance. He is truthful and trusty, speaking peace to all men. The men of Islam see him but once in the year. The pilgrims that come from distant lands to go unto Mecca which is in the land El-Yemen, are anxious to see his face, and they assemble before the palace exclaiming ""Our Lord, light of Islam and glory of our Law, show us the effulgence of thy countenance,"" but he pays no regard to their words. Then the princes who minister unto him say to him, ""Our Lord, spread forth thy peace unto the men that have come from distant lands, who crave to abide under the shadow of thy graciousness,"" and thereupon he arises and lets down the hem of his robe from the window, and the pilgrims come and kiss it, and a prince says unto them ""Go forth in peace, for our Master the Lord of Islam granteth peace to you."" He is regarded by them as Mohammed and they go to their houses rejoicing at the salutation which the prince has vouchsafed unto them, and glad at heart that they have kissed his robe.
 Each of his brothers and the members of his family has an abode in his palace, but they are all fettered in chains of iron, and guards are placed over each of their houses so that they may not rise against the great Caliph. For once it happened to a predecessor that his brothers rose up against him and proclaimed one of themselves as Caliph; then it was decreed that all the members of his family should be bound, that they might not rise up against the ruling Caliph. Each one of them resides in his palace in great splendour, and they own villages and towns, and their stewards bring them the tribute thereof, and they eat and drink and rejoice all the days of their life. Within the domains of the palace of the Caliph there are great buildings of marble and columns of silver and gold, and7 carvings upon rare stones are fixed in the walls. In the Caliph's palace are great riches and towers filled with gold, silken garments and all precious stones. He does not issue forth from his palace save once in the year, at the feast which the Mohammedans call El-id-bed Ramazan, and they come from distant lands that day to see him. He rides on a mule and is attired in the royal robes of gold and silver and fine linen; on his head is a turban adorned with precious stones of priceless value, and over the turban is a black shawl as a sign of his modesty, implying that all this glory will be covered by darkness on the day of death. He is accompanied by all the nobles of Islam dressed in fine garments and riding on horses, the princes of Arabia, the princes of Togarma and Daylam (Gilān) and the princes of Persia, Media and Ghuzz, and the princes of the land of Tibet, which is three months' journey distant, and westward of which lies the land of Samarkand. He proceeds from his palace to the great mosque of Islam which is by the Basrah Gate. Along the road the walls are adorned with silk and purple, and the inhabitants receive him with all kinds of song and exultation, and they dance before the great king who is styled the Caliph. They salute him with a loud voice and say, ""Peace unto thee, our Lord the King and Light of Islam!"" He kisses his robe, and stretching forth the hem thereof he salutes them. Then he proceeds to the court of the mosque, mounts a wooden pulpit and expounds to them their Law. Then the learned ones of Islam arise and pray for him and extol his greatness and his graciousness, to which they all respond. Afterwards he gives them his blessing, and they bring before him a camel which he slays, and this is their passover-sacrifice. He gives thereof unto the princes and they distribute it to all, so that they may taste of the sacrifice brought by their sacred king; and they all rejoice. Afterwards he leaves the mosque and returns alone to his palace by way of the river Hiddekel, and the grandees of Islam accompany him in ships on the river until he enters his palace. He does not return the way he came; and the road which he takes along the river-side is watched all the year through, so that no man shall tread in his footsteps. He does not leave the palace again for a whole year. He is a benevolent man.
 
 He built, on the other side of the river, on the banks of an arm of the Euphrates which there borders the city, a hospital consisting of blocks of houses and hospices for the sick poor who come to be healed. Here there are about sixty physicians' stores which are provided from the Caliph's house with drugs and whatever else may be required. Every sick man who comes is maintained at the Caliph's expense and is medically treated. Here is a building which is called Dar-al-Maristan, where they keep charge of the demented people who have become insane in the towns through the great heat in the summer, and they chain each of them in iron chains until their reason becomes restored to them in the winter-time. Whilst they abide there, they are provided with food from the house of the Caliph, and when their reason is restored they are dismissed and each one of them goes to his house and his home. Money is given to those that have stayed in the hospices on their return to their homes. Every month the officers of the Caliph inquire and investigate whether they have regained their reason, in which case they are discharged. All this the Caliph does out of charity to those that come to the city of Bagdad, whether they be sick or insane. The Caliph is a righteous man, and all his actions are for good.
 In Bagdad there are about 40,000 Jews, and they dwell in security, prosperity and honour under the great Caliph, and amongst them are great sages, the heads of Academies engaged in the study of the law. In this city there are ten Academies. At the head of the great Academy is the chief rabbi R. Samuel, the son of Eli. He is the head of the Academy Gaon Jacob. He is a Levite, and traces his pedigree back to Moses our teacher. The head of the second Academy is R. Hanania his brother, warden of the Levites; R. Daniel is the head of the third Academy; R. Elazar the scholar is the head of the fourth Academy; and R. Elazar, the son of Zemach, is the head of the order, and his pedigree reaches to Samuel the prophet, the Korahite. He and his brethren know how to chant the melodies as did the singers at the time when the Temple was standing. He is head of the fifth Academy. R. Hisdai, the glory of the scholars, is head of the sixth Academy. R. Haggai is head of the seventh Academy. R. Ezra is the head of the eighth Academy. R. Abraham, who is called Abu Tahir, is the head of the ninth Academy. R. Zakkai, the son of Bostanai the Nasi, is the head of the Sium. These are the ten Batlanim, and they do not engage in any other work than communal administration; and all the days of the week they judge the Jews their countrymen, except on the second day of the week, when they all appear before the chief rabbi Samuel, the head of the Yeshiba Gaon (Jacob), who in conjunction with the other Batlanim judges all those that appear before him. And at the head of them all is Daniel the son of Hisdai, who is styled ""Our Lord the Head of the Captivity of all Israel."" He possesses a book of pedigrees going back as far as David, King of Israel. The Jews call him ""Our Lord, Head of the Captivity,"" and the Mohammedans call him ""Saidna ben Daoud,"" and he has been invested with authority over all the congregations of Israel at the hands of the Emir al Muminin, the Lord of Islam.
 For thus Mohammed commanded concerning him and his descendants; and he granted him a seal of office over all the congregations that dwell under his rule, and ordered that every one, whether Mohammedan or Jew, or belonging to any other nation in his dominion, should rise up before him (the Exilarch) and salute him, and that any one who should refuse to rise up should receive one hundred stripes.
 
 And every fifth day when he goes to pay a visit to the great Caliph, horsemen, Gentiles as well as Jews, escort him, and heralds proclaim in advance, ""Make way before our Lord, the son of David, as is due unto him,"" the Arabic words being ""Amilu tarik la Saidna ben Daud."" He is mounted on a horse, and is attired in robes of silk and embroidery with a large turban on his head, and from the turban is suspended a long white cloth adorned with a chain upon which the cipher of Mohammed is engraved. Then he appears before the Caliph and kisses his hand, and the Caliph rises and places him on a throne which Mohammed had ordered to be made for him, and all the Mohammedan princes who attend the court of the Caliph rise up before him. And the Head of the Captivity is seated on his throne opposite to the Caliph, in compliance with the command of Mohammed to give effect to what is written in the law—""The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a law-giver from between his feet, until he come to Shiloh: and to him shall the gathering of the people be."" The authority of the Head of the Captivity extends over all the communities of Shinar, Persia, Khurasan and Sheba which is El-Yemen, and Diyar Kalach (Bekr) and the land of Aram Naharaim (Mesopotamia), and over the dwellers in the mountains of Ararat and the land of the Alans, which is a land surrounded by mountains and has no outlet except by the iron gates which Alexander made, but which were afterwards broken. Here are the people called Alani. His authority extends also over the land of Siberia, and the communities in the land of the Togarmim unto the mountains of Asveh and the land of Gurgan, the inhabitants of which are called Gurganim who dwell by the river Gihon, and these are the Girgashites who follow the Christian religion. Further it extends to the gates of Samarkand, the land of Tibet, and the land of India. In respect of all these countries the Head of the Captivity gives the communities power to appoint Rabbis and Ministers who come unto him to be consecrated and to receive his authority. They bring him offerings and gifts from the ends of the earth. He owns hospices, gardens and plantations in Babylon, and much land inherited from his fathers, and no one can take his possessions from him by force. He has a fixed weekly revenue arising from the hospices of the Jews, the markets and the merchants, apart from that which is brought to him from far-off lands. The man is very rich, and wise in the Scriptures as well as in the Talmud, and many Israelites dine at his table every day.
 At his installation, the Head of the Captivity gives much money to the Caliph, to the Princes and the Ministers. On the day that the Caliph performs the ceremony of investing him with authority, he rides in the second of the royal equipages, and is escorted from the palace of the Caliph to his own house with timbrels and fifes. The Exilarch appoints the Chiefs of the Academies by placing his hand upon their heads, thus installing them in their office. The Jews of the city are learned men and very rich.
 
 In Bagdad there are twenty-eight Jewish Synagogues, situated either in the city itself or in Al-Karkh on the other side of the Tigris; for the river divides the metropolis into two parts. The great synagogue of the Head of the Captivity has columns of marble of various colours overlaid with silver and gold, and on these columns are sentences of the Psalms in golden letters. And in front of the ark are about ten steps of marble; on the topmost step are the seats of the Head of the Captivity and of the Princes of the House of David. The city of Bagdad is twenty miles in circumference, situated in a land of palms, gardens and plantations, the like of which is not to be found in the whole land of Shinar. People come thither with merchandise from all lands. Wise men live there, philosophers who know all manner of wisdom, and magicians expert in all manner of witchcraft.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

It is fronted by sixty turrets, and between each turret there is a minor Synagogue, and in the court of the Synagogue is the ark, and at the back of the Synagogue is the sepulchre of Ezekiel. It is surmounted by a large cupola, and it is a very handsome structure. It was built of old by King Jeconiah, king of Judah, and the 35,000 Jews who came with him, when Evil-merodach brought him forth out of prison. This place is by the river Chebar on the one side, and by the river Euphrates on the other, and the names of Jeconiah and those that accompanied him are engraved on the wall: Jeconiah at the top, and Ezekiel at the bottom. This place is held sacred by Israel as a lesser sanctuary unto this day, and people come from a distance to pray there from the time of the New Year until the Day of Atonement. The Israelites have great rejoicings on these occasions. Thither also come the Head of the Captivity, and the Heads of the Academies from Bagdad. Their camp occupies a space of about two miles, and Arab merchants come there as well. A great gathering like a fair takes place, which is called Fera, and they bring forth a scroll of the Law written on parchment by Ezekiel the Prophet, and read from it on the Day of Atonement. A lamp burns day and night over the sepulchre of Ezekiel; the light thereof has been kept burning from the day that he lighted it himself, and they continually renew the wick thereof, and replenish the oil unto the present day. A large house belonging to the sanctuary is filled with books, some of them from the time of the first temple, and some from the time of the second temple, and he who has no sons consecrates his books to its use. The Jews that come thither to pray from the land of Persia and Media bring the money which their countrymen have offered to the Synagogue of Ezekiel the Prophet. The Synagogue owns property, lands and villages, which belonged to King Jeconiah, and when Mohammed came he confirmed all these rights to the Synagogue of Ezekiel. Distinguished Mohammedans also come hither to pray, so great is their love for Ezekiel the Prophet; and they call it Bar (Dar) Melicha (the Dwelling of Beauty). All the Arabs come there to pray.
 At a distance of about half a mile from the Synagogue are the sepulchres of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and upon their sepulchres are large cupolas; and even at times of disturbance no man would dare touch the Mohammedan or Jewish servants who attend at the sepulchre of Ezekiel.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

Sepulchre of Daniel,,32.19031,48.24373,Benjamin of Tudela,1160,"In front of one of the synagogues is the sepulchre of Daniel of blessed memory. The river Tigris divides the city, and the bridge connects the two parts. On the one side where the Jews dwell is the sepulchre of Daniel. Here the market-places used to be, containing great stores of merchandise, by which the Jews became enriched. On the other side of the bridge they were poor, because they had no market-places nor merchants there, only gardens and plantations. And they became jealous, and said ""All this prosperity enjoyed by those on the other side is due to the merits of Daniel the prophet who lies buried there."" Then the poor people asked those who dwelt on the other side to place the sepulchre of Daniel in their midst, but the others would not comply. So war prevailed between them for many days, and no one went forth or came in on account of the great strife between them. At length both parties growing tired of this state of things took a wise view of the matter, and made a compact, namely, that the coffin of Daniel should be taken for one year to the one side and for another year to the other side. This they did, and both sides became rich. In the course of time Sinjar Shah-ben-Shah, who ruled over the kingdom of Persia and had forty-five kings subject to his authority, came to this place. 
 He is called Sultan-al-Fars-al-Khabir in Arabic (the mighty Sovereign of Persia), and it is he who ruled from the river Samara unto the city of Samarkand, and unto the river Gozan and the cities of Media and the mountains of Chafton. He ruled also over Tibet, in the forests whereof one finds the animals from which the musk is obtained. The extent of his Empire is a journey of four months. When this great Emperor Sinjar, king of Persia, saw that they took the coffin of Daniel from one side of the river to the other, and that a great multitude of Jews, Mohammedans and Gentiles, and many people from the country were crossing the bridge, he asked the meaning of this proceeding, and they told him these things. He said, ""It is not meet to do this ignominy unto Daniel the prophet, but I command you to measure the bridge from both sides, and to take the coffin of Daniel and place it inside another coffin of crystal, so that the wooden coffin be within that of crystal, and to suspend this from the middle of the bridge by a chain of iron; at this spot you must build a synagogue for all comers, so that whoever wishes to pray there, be he Jew or Gentile, may do so."" And to this very day the coffin is suspended from the bridge. And the king commanded that out of respect for Daniel no fisherman should catch fish within a mile above or a mile below.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

Mulahid,,36.44456,50.58595,Benjamin of Tudela,1160,"[Location for the Castle that Hasan-i Sabbah (Old Man) lived in at his death.]
 Thence it is four days to the land of Mulahid. Here live a people who do not profess the Mohammedan religion, but live on high mountains, and worship the Old Man of the land of the Hashishim. And among them there are four communities of Israel who go forth with them in war-time. They are not under the rule of the king of Persia, but reside in the high mountains, and descend from these mountains to pillage and to capture booty, and then return to the mountains, and none can overcome them. There are learned men amongst the Jews of their land. These Jews are under the authority of the Head of the Captivity in Babylon. Thence it is five days to Amadia where there are about 25,000 Israelites. This is the first of those communities that dwell in the mountains of Chafton, where there are more than 100 Jewish communities. Here is the commencement of the land of Media. These Jews belong to the first captivity which King Shalmanezar led away; and they speak the language in which the Targum is written. Amongst them are learned men. The communities reach from the province of Amadia unto the province of Gilan, twenty-five days distant, on the border of the kingdom of Persia. They are under the authority of the king of Persia, and he raises a tribute from them through the hands of his officer, and the tribute which they pay every year by way of poll tax is one gold amir, which is equivalent to one and one-third maravedi. At this place (Amadia), there arose this day ten years ago, a man named David Alroy of the city of Amadia. He studied under Chisdai the Head of the Captivity, and under the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, in the city of Bagdad, and he was well versed in the Law of Israel, in the Halachah, as well as in the Talmud, and in all the wisdom of the Mohammedans, also in secular literature and in the writings of magicians and soothsayers. He conceived the idea of rebelling against the king of Persia, and of collecting the Jews who live in the mountains of Chafton to go forth and to fight against all the nations, and to march and capture Jerusalem. He showed signs by pretended miracles to the Jews, and said, ""The Holy One, blessed be He, sent me to capture Jerusalem and to free you from the yoke of the Gentiles."" And the Jews believed in him and called him their Messiah. When the king of Persia heard of it he sent for him to come and speak with him. Alroy went to him without fear, and when he had audience of the king, the latter asked him, ""Art thou the king of the Jews?"" He answered, ""I am."" Then the king was wrath, and commanded that he should be seized and placed in the prison of the king, the place where the king's prisoners were bound unto the day of their death, in the city of Tabaristan which is on the large river Gozan. At the end of three days, whilst the king was sitting deliberating with his princes concerning the Jews who had rebelled, David suddenly stood before them. He had escaped from the prison without the knowledge of any man. And when the king saw him, he said to him, ""Who brought thee hither, and who has released thee?"" ""My own wisdom and skill,"" answered the other; ""for I am not afraid of thee, nor of any of thy servants."" The king forthwith loudly bade his servants to seize him, but they answered, ""We cannot see any man, although our ears hear him."" Then the king and all his princes marvelled at his subtlety; but he said to the king ""I will go my way""; so he went forth. And the king went after him; and the princes and servants followed their king until they came to the river-side. Then Alroy took off his mantle and spread it on the face of the water to cross thereon. When the servants of the king saw that he crossed the water on his mantle, they pursued him in small boats, wishing to bring him back, but they were unable, and they said, ""There is no wizard like this in the whole world."" That self-same day he went a journey of ten days to the city of Amadia by the strength of the ineffable Name, and he told the Jews all that had befallen him, and they were astonished at his wisdom.
 After that the king of Persia sent word to the Emir Al-Muminin, the Caliph of the Mohammedans at Bagdad, urging him to warn the Head of the Exile, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, to restrain David Alroy from executing his designs. And he threatened that he would otherwise slay all the Jews in his Empire. Then all the congregations of the land of Persia were in great trouble. And the Head of the Captivity, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, sent to Alroy, saying, ""The time of redemption is not yet arrived; we have not yet seen the signs thereof; for by strength shall no man prevail. Now our mandate is, that thou cease from these designs, or thou shalt surely be excommunicated from all Israel."" And they sent unto Zakkai the Nasi in the land of Assur (Mosul) and unto R. Joseph Burhan-al-mulk the astronomer there, bidding them to send on the letter to Alroy, and furthermore they themselves wrote to him to warn him, but he would not accept the warning. Then there arose a king of the name of Sin-ed-din, the king of the Togarmim, and a vassal of the king of Persia, who sent to the father-in-law of David Alroy, and gave him a bribe of 10,000 gold pieces to slay Alroy in secret. So he went to Alroy's house, and slew him whilst he was asleep on his bed. Thus were his plans frustrated. Then the king of Persia went forth against the Jews that lived in the mountain; and they sent to the Head of the Captivity to come to their assistance and to appease the king. He was eventually appeased by a gift of 100 talents of gold, which they gave him, and the land was at peace thereafter.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

Naisabur,,36.21319,58.79427,Benjamin of Tudela,1160,"Thence it takes twenty-eight days to the mountains of Naisabur by the river Gozan. And there are men of Israel in the land of Persia who say that in the mountains of Naisabur four of the tribes of Israel dwell, namely, the tribe of Dan, the tribe of Zebulun, the tribe of Asher, and the tribe of Naphtali, who were included in the first captivity of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, as it is written (2 Kings xviii. 11): ""And he put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes.""
 The extent of their land is twenty days' journey, and they have cities and large villages in the mountains; the river Gozan forms the boundary on the one side. They are not under the rule of the Gentiles, but they have a prince of their own, whose name is R. Joseph Amarkala the Levite. There are scholars among them. And they sow and reap and go forth to war as far as the land of Cush by way of the desert.
 They are in league with the Kofar-al-Turak, who worship the wind and live in the wilderness, and who do not eat bread, nor drink wine, but live on raw uncooked meat. They have no noses, and in lieu thereof they have two small holes, through which they breathe. They eat animals both clean and unclean, and they are very friendly towards the Israelites. Fifteen years ago they overran the country of Persia with a large army and took the city of Rayy; they smote it with the edge of the sword, took all the spoil thereof, and returned by way of the wilderness. Such an invasion had not been known in the land of Persia for many years. When the king of Persia heard thereof his anger was kindled against them, and he said, ""Not in my days nor in the days of my fathers did an army sally forth from this wilderness. Now I will go and cut off their name from the earth."" A proclamation was made throughout his Empire, and he assembled all his armies; and he sought a guide who might show him the way to their encampment. And a certain man said that he would show him the way, as he was one of them. And the king promised that he would enrich him if he did so. And the king asked him as to what provisions they would require for the march through the wilderness. And he replied, ""Take with you bread and wine for fifteen days, for you will find no sustenance by the way, till you have reached their land."" And they did so, and marched through the wilderness for fifteen days, but they found nothing at all. And their food began to give out, so that man and beast were dying of hunger and thirst. Then the king called the guide, and said to him, ""Where is your promise to us that you would find our adversaries?"" To which the other replied, ""I have mistaken the way."" And the king was wroth, and commanded that his head should be struck off. And the king further gave orders throughout the camp that every man who had any food should divide it with his neighbour. And they consumed everything they had including their beasts. And after a further thirteen days' march they reached the mountains of Naisabur, where Jews lived. They came there on the Sabbath, and encamped in the gardens and plantations and by the springs of water which are by the side of the river Gozan. Now it was the time of the ripening of the fruit, and they ate and consumed everything. No man came forth to them, but on the mountains they saw cities and many towers.
 Then the king commanded two of his servants to go and inquire of the people who lived in the mountains, and to cross the river either in boats or by swimming. So they searched and found a large bridge, on which there were three towers, but the gate of the bridge was locked. And on the other side of the bridge was a great city. Then they shouted in front of the bridge till a man came forth and asked them what they wanted and who they were. But they did not understand him till an interpreter came who understood their language. And when he asked them, they said, ""We are the servants of the king of Persia, and we have come to ask who you are, and whom you serve."" To which the other replied: ""We are Jews; we have no king and no Gentile prince, but a Jewish prince rules over us."" They then questioned him with regard to the infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the Kofar-al-Turak, and he answered: ""Truly they are in league with us, and he who seeks to do them harm seeks our harm."" Then they went their way, and told the king of Persia, who was much alarmed. And on a certain day the Jews asked him to join combat with them, but he answered: ""I am not come to fight you, but the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and if you fight against me I will be avenged on you by killing all the Jews in my Empire; I know that you are stronger than I am in this place, and my army has come out of this great wilderness starving and athirst. Deal kindly with me and do not fight against me, but leave me to engage with the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and sell me also the provisions which I require for myself and my army."" The Jews then took counsel together, and resolved to propitiate the king on account of the Jews who were in exile in his Empire. Then the king entered their land with his army, and stayed there fifteen days. And they showed him much honour, and also sent a dispatch to the Kofar-al-Turak their allies, reporting the matter to them. Thereupon the latter occupied the mountain passes in force with a large army composed of all those who dwelt in that desert, and when the king of Persia went forth to fight with them, they placed themselves in battle array against him. The Kofar-al-Turak army was victorious and slew many of the Persian host, and the king of Persia fled with only a few followers to his own country.
 Now a horseman, one of the servants of the king of Persia, enticed a Jew, whose name was R. Moses, to come with him, and when he came to the land of Persia this horseman made the Jew his slave. One day the archers came before the king to give a display of their skill and no one among them could be found to draw the bow like this R. Moses. Then the king inquired of him by means of an interpreter who knew his language, and he related all that the horseman had done to him. Thereupon the king at once granted him his liberty, had him clad in robes of silk, gave him gifts, and said to him, ""If thou wilt embrace our religion, I will make thee a rich man and steward of my house,"" but he answered, My lord, I cannot do this thing."" Then the king took him and placed him in the house of the Chief Rabbi of the Ispahan community, Sar Shalom, who gave him his daughter to wife. This same R. Moses told me all these things.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

These are the sons of Cush, who read the stars, and are all black in colour. They are honest in commerce. When merchants come to them from distant lands and enter the harbour, three of the King's secretaries go down to them and record their names, and then bring them before the King, whereupon the King makes himself responsible even for their property which they leave in the open, unprotected. There is an official who sits in his office, and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it to him when he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. From Passover to New Year, that is all during the summer, no man can go out of his house because of the sun, for the heat in that country is intense, and from the third hour of the day onward, everybody remains in his house till the evening. Then they go forth and kindle lights in all the market places and all the streets, and then do their work and business at night-time. For they have to turn night into day in consequence of the great heat of the sun. Pepper is found there. They plant the trees thereof in the fields, and each man of the city knows his own plantation. The trees are small, and the pepper is as white as snow. And when they have collected it, they place it in saucepans and pour boiling water over it, so that it may become strong. They then take it out of the water and dry it in the sun, and it turns black. Calamus and ginger and many other kinds of spice are found in this land.
 The people of this country do not bury their dead, but embalm them by means of various spices, after which they place them on chairs and cover them with fine linen. And each family has a house where it preserves the embalmed remains of its ancestors and relations. The flesh hardens on the bones, and the embalmed bodies look like living beings, so that every man can recognize his parents, and the members of his family for many years. They worship the sun, and they have high places everywhere outside the city at a distance of2 about half a mile. And every morning they run forth to greet the sun, for on every high place a solar disc is made of cunning workmanship and as the sun rises the disc rotates with thundering noise, and all, both men and women, offer incense to the sun with censers in their hands. Such are their superstitious practices. And throughout the island, including all the towns there, live several thousand Israelites. The inhabitants are all black, and the Jews also. The latter are good and benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and Halacha.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

The waters remain upon the surface of the land during the months of Elul and Tishri, and irrigate and fertilize it.
 The inhabitants have a pillar of marble, erected with much skill, in order to ascertain the extent of the rise of the Nile. It stands in the front of an island in the midst of the water, and is twelve cubits high. When the Nile rises and covers the column, 0they know that the river has risen and has covered the land for a distance of fifteen days' journey to its full extent. If only half the column is covered, the water only covers half the extent of the land. And day by day an officer takes a measurement on the column and makes proclamation thereof in Zoan and in the city of Mizraim, proclaiming: ""Give praise unto the Creator, for the river this day has risen to such and such a height""; each day he takes the measurement and makes his proclamation. If the water covers the entire column, there will be abundance throughout Egypt. The river continues to rise gradually till it covers the land to the extent of fifteen days' journey. He who owns a field hires workmen, who dig deep trenches in his field, and fish come with the rise of the water and enter the trenches. Then, when the waters have receded, the fish remain behind in the trenches, and the owners of the fields take them and either eat them or sell them to the fishmongers, who salt them and deal in them in every place. These fish are exceedingly fat and large, and the oil obtained from them is used in this land for lamp-oil. Though a man eat a great quantity of these fish, if he but drink1 Nile water afterwards they will not hurt him, for the waters have medicinal properties.
 People ask, what causes the Nile to rise? The Egyptians say that up the river, in the land of Al-Habash (Abyssinia), which is the land of Havilah, much rain descends at the time of the rising of the river, and that this abundance of rain causes the river to rise and to cover the surface of the land. If the river does not rise, there is no sowing, and famine is sore in the land. Sowing is done in the month of Marheshwan, after the river has gone back to its ordinary channel. In the month of Adar is the barley-harvest, and in the month of Nisan the wheat-harvest.
 In the month of Nisan they have cherries, pears, cucumbers, and gourds in plenty, also beans, peas, chickpeas, and many kinds of vegetables, such as purslane, asparagus, pulse, lettuce, coriander, endive, cabbage, leek, and cardoon. The land is full of all good things, and the gardens and plantations are watered from the various reservoirs and by the river-water.
 The river Nile, after flowing past (the city of) Mizraim, divides into four heads: one channel proceeds in the direction of Damietta, which is Caphtor, where it falls into the sea. The second channel flows to the city of Reshid (Rosetta), which is near Alexandria, and there falls into the sea; the third channel goes by way of Ashmun, where it falls into the sea; and the fourth channel goes as far as the frontier of Egypt. Along both banks of these four river-heads are cities, towns and villages, and people visit these places either by ship or by land. There is no such thickly-populated land as this elsewhere. It is extensive too and abundant in all good things.","Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, trans.

New York City,"New York City, New York",40.7351,-73.9913,William Henry Charlton,1873,"New York has been called the most American city in the United States. I can only say, that one moment I was reminded of England, and in the next of France. The private houses are, however, almost all built in the English style, with the differences of the front door being reached from the street by a flight of eight or ten steps, and that of the drawing and dining rooms being almost invariably on the ground floor, and opening into one another. The afternoon being fine, we took a drive round the Central Park, a space of about one thousand acres, in what will probably, by the end of this century, be the middle of the city of New York. The park has been laid out with great skill in landscape gardening, the artist having ably availed himself of the natural rock which comes frequently to the surface, and created one or two beautiful sheets of water. The trees, from not having been planted more than twenty years, are still rather small; but the park is kept in admirable order, and intersected by excellent roads and walks, while the roadway of most of the streets of New York, and indeed of most of the American and Canadian cities that I have seen, is execrable and filthy. I could not help remarking the lightness and elegance of the American carriages of all descriptions, and cannot understand why we in England have never adopted a style of carriage building, which seems to be as strong as ours, and would certainly be the saving of a great deal of useless labour to our horses. After a stay of two days in New York, and having experienced a specimen of its climate, the thermometer having fallen nearly thirty degrees in the space of four or five hours, and the weather having become bitterly cold, we intended to avail ourselves of the steamer to
  ascend the Hudson for one hundred miles.","William Henry Charlton, Four Months in North America (Hexham, England: J. Catherall and Co., 1873), 5-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/56842/56842.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",43.6759,-79.3698,William Henry Charlton,1873,"Toronto, the capital of the Province of Ontario, in the Dominion of Canada, is a large and thriving place, built in the usual American style, with wide, ill-kept streets, crossing each other at right angles, and planted at the sides with trees. The town stands upon what is nearly a dead flat, for it is not on the shores of the great lakes of North America, that we must look for picturesque scenery; and except a cathedral and a university it seems to have no public buildings of importance. A large proportion of the inhabtiants are of Scotch and Northern Irish birth or extraction, and the Province of Ontario has, I believe, but few French Canadians, and still fewer Germans within its limits. Settlers of the latter nation abound, as is well known, in many parts of the United States, and are said to number upwards of three hundred thousand in the city of New York alone. The wages of a working man are considerably lower in the Province of Ontario than in the adjoining State of New York, where a man will get three-and-a-half dollars per day, against two dollars on the Canadian side.","William Henry Charlton, Four Months in North America (Hexham, England: J.

Quebec,"Québec City, Quebec",46.7978,-71.2604,William Henry Charlton,1873,"Early next morning we were at the landing place at Quebec, and I could have imagined myself transported during the night across the Atlantic, and set down in some old provincial town in the west of France. The steep, narrow, crooked, and dirty streets; the houses, the churches, the people—all were more or less French. Three-fourths of the people of Quebec speak French as their native tongue though many of them can also express themselves well in English, but in the surrounding villages, I believe, very little English is even understood.","William Henry Charlton, Four Months in North America (Hexham, England: J.

Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",42.3576,-71.0635,William Henry Charlton,1873,"We remained at Boston only five days. This city, which shortly after our departure, suffered from a fire second only in its disastrous effects to that of Chicago, was by far the most English looking town I had yet seen in America. The older portions of Boston seem to have been modelled after the City of London, and Beacon Street and The Common are almost fac-similes of our Piccadilly and Green Park. In the Public Garden adjoining the Common, is a fine bronze equestrian statue of General Washington, by Ball. I mention this, because as far as I have seen, Washington, like some great men in our own country, has not, generally speaking, been fortunate in the statues erected to his memory. As it was the eve of the Presidential election, politics, as might have been expected, ran pretty high at Boston during our stay.","William Henry Charlton, Four Months in North America (Hexham, England: J.

"Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C.",38.8991,-77.0348,William Henry Charlton,1873,"To be the capital of a great country it must be owned that Washington is an extraordinary looking place. It has no trade, and the Potomac, on whose banks it stands, though a tidal river, is only navigable for vessels of light draught. The climate being excessively hot in summer, and often very cold and windy in winter, the streets have been judiciously laid out in straight lines, and with an enormous breadth, so as to secure to passengers the full benefit of wind, dust, mud, and a burning sun, according to the season. As regards the mud, however, I am bound to add that very great efforts were being made at the time of our visit, by the employment of a host of negroes, to pave and asphalte the streets, so that in another year or so, a drive through Washington may be a pleasure instead of a punishment. These improvements unfortunately have had the effect of more than doubling the city taxation, which is still, I believe, on the increase. The houses which border these wide streets, are, with the exception of the public buildings, and of some few private houses, of the meanest description, being inferior to those of a secondrate provincial town in England. The same observations will apply to the shops, or stores as they are universally called in America. Their prices are at least, double what they would be with us, and their goods generally of inferior quality. The city, which, with its far more picturesque suburb of Georgetown, contains about one hundred thousand inhabitants, has no theatre worthy of the name, and no public drive or promenade. Having gone thus far in the way of depreciation, it will be only fair to state what may be said in the way of approval. The Capitol is a truly magnificent building. Placed, as it is, on the highest ground in the city, its lofty dome and walls of white marble form a conspicuous object from afar, and the impression of its grandeur is not diminished by a nearer view, though its architecture cannot be termed absolutely faultless. The finer front is unfortunately that which is turned from the city, and looks to the eastward.","William Henry Charlton, Four Months in North America (Hexham, England: J.

New York City,"New York City, New York",40.774,-73.9733,T.S. Hudson,1882,"We drove through Central Park, a breathing-space in every way worthy of the Empire City which encircles it. Returning seaward we found Broadway not such a broad way as its name and reputation justified us in expecting. In width and length it is not unlike Oxford-street. Some of the buildings are much handsomer than the majority of those in the great London thoroughfare, and others are paltry and altogether unworthy of the vicinity. Flagstaffs adorn many of the edifices, and their huge banners, bearing in many instances the name of the owner of the emporium or “store,” floated out upon the breeze. The wind blowing across the line of the street caused the bunting to spread nearly from roof to roof, which had a pleasing effect as the flags spread out against the background of blue sky.","T.S.

The latter is surrounded by granite columns, each in one
  piece of forty tons weight. We ascended by the “elevator,” as the lift or hoist is invariably termed (an indispensable adjunct to every American building of any pretensions) to the roof of the palatial offices of the Equitable Insurance Association, and obtained from a height of a hundred and eighty feet a complete panorama of the place; the monument on Bunker's Hill, and that on the Common to the citizens who fell in the war with the South, being conspicuous.","T.S.

Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",39.9765,-75.1456,T.S. Hudson,1882,"We journeyed to Philadelphia by the Bound Brook route. The weather continued very cold, but bright. It was a strange coincidence that one year ago to-day we had occasion also to note unusual cold for the time of year, having then (21st April) experienced snow in Vienna. We found the roadways of Philadelphia even more rugged and uneven than those of New York, there being huge holes in the middle of the best streets, and the crossings were very bad. The railways are all on the level, and the locomotives with their great clanging bells in place of whistles, are mixed up with the “street cars” and “stages.” The trams were all drawn by horses or mules, and none of them had seats on the top, as at Hamburg and other European cities, where a fine view of the neighbourhood can be taken at a small cost by riding to the various suburbs upon a steam or horse-drawn car. We had a splendidly clear day for inspecting the largest city in area in the country, and second in population, there being nearly a million inhabitants. Brook Street is twenty-three miles long, and it and Market Street are fine thoroughfares, but the other streets are poor, and have all the objectionable points of American cities—open drains, filthy and rotten wooden shades over the footpaths, rough telegraph posts, &c.","T.S.

Baltimore,"Baltimore, Maryland",39.2907,-76.6014,T.S. Hudson,1882,"A staple industry of Baltimore is preserving oysters in tins. An inexhaustible supply of large and excellent bivalves is procured from the neighbouring Bay of the Chesapeake, and although they become out of season for local consumption, the “tinning” goes on all the year round. Possibly by the time they come to be eaten they have become in season. A peculiar sight was a a hill composed of hundreds of tons of oystershells which are disposed of to make roads, or burnt to make excellent lime. Inspection of the City Hall and the usual edifices and monuments occupied the afternoon, and we took our departure for Washington not much impressed by the architecture of the somewhat ostentatiously termed City of Monuments. The title was doubtless acquired when the monuments were many and the houses few; now the city has increased tenfold and the statues and columns are comparatively scarce.","T.S.

"Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C.",38.8918,-77.0369,T.S. Hudson,1882,"Right gay was the city of Washington as we ascended the steps to the back door of the Capitol. For be it known that this pretentious erection turns its back upon the city, the sixtons statue of Liberty, which tops the dome, facing the other way. The grand bronze doors cast at Munich—the principal façade, and the portico whence each new President is proclaimed, are at the further side of the building. This is explained by the fact that it was intended for the heart of the legislative metropolis to lie to the east of the Capitol, and for the White House, a mile and a half to the west, to be a retired residence for the President away in the suburbs. Very few houses have, however, been built to the eastward, the avenues laid out towards the west having been built upon in a spread-out fashion. Washington selected the site himself, and it was laid out according to his plan, but as the eighty intervening years have passed over with only a comparatively small amount of building going on—and that mostly where the outskirts were intended to be—the city covers a very large area for its population of only a hundred and fifty thousand. Hence its “Magnificent Distances” title. The prospect from the balconies of the Capitol is an extensive and pleasing one, the absence of smoke, owing to the use of anthracite coal, allowing a clear view for many miles. The main thoroughfares, radiating as boulevards like the spokes of a wheel from this centre-point, betoken the conception of a model city. One division of the circle has been kept entirely in the possession of the nation, and within it are the national conservatories and other federal institutions. An ugly railway station had been recently protruded into this reserved portion, but it was evident at a glance that sooner or later it would have to be removed. Every American is proud of Washington, and they all cried out against this eyesore. An unfinished column, intended to be crowned by a colossal statue of the Great General, stood far away, over in the Mall; but work was suspended owing to lack of funds. The Capitol is characteristic of the Americans, for, immense sums of money having been spent upon it, they mar the whole thing by stinting a few dollars upon it at the finish. The lamp-posts which adorn (?) the steps and balconies would be put to shame by an ordinary gin-palace gas lamp; and in front of the building is a dirty pool of water containing a few hungry gold-fish, and surrounded by a rusty iron paling, where a handsome fountain would fitly have decorated the approach.","T.S.

Wyoming Territory,Wyoming,41.9848,-104.0684,T.S. Hudson,1882,"Our course lay along the north bank (or rather shore, for it was as flat as a pancake) of the River Platte, as far as Cheyenne, where we entered the territory of Wyoming, having seen spreading prairies for the first time in something like their vast nakedness and solitude. Settlements and farms there were; but, unlike those left behind us, they seemed to be swallowed up in the immensity of the boundless levels which rolled off to the horizon like the sea. For forty miles at one stretch was the railway as straight as if drawn by a ruler. Herds of antelope were feeding; and “villages,” as they call them, of prairie-dogs broke the monotony of the plains. We saw trains of emigrant waggons, bound Westward Ho, slowly drawn along by sturdy mules. These caravans were the straggling successors of the thousands of bullock, drawn waggons that wended in long trains up the course of the Platte in pre-railroad days, sometimes for miles actually in the shallow water or dry part of the bed of the stream. Scores of skeletons of oxen, and some in less advanced stages of decomposition (as many as a dozen could be counted in as many minutes), showed the small value of the carcases at this distance from populous places; neither skin, horns, nor hoofs being removed. As an example of the mode of life up in these regions Cheyenne may be quoted. Its altitude is six thousand and forty-one feet, and population about as many souls as it is feet above the level of the sea. Endless and poor-looking prairies surround it, and it looks as though snow in winter and dust in summer would be its chief characteristics; and its ostensible sources of income, supplying refreshments to travellers, and the carrying on of the waggon and locomotive shops connected with the railway.","T.S.

Stockton,"Stockton, California",37.9669,-121.305,T.S. Hudson,1882,"Arrived at Stockton, we found a staid, solid town, with thirteen churches, some banks, and fair public buildings. Upon one substantial edifice was inscribed, “First National Bank of Stockton.” The place was not named, as is sometimes stated (so said the directory), after a “small” town of that name in the North of England, but after General Stockton, who assisted in the capture of California. The country around is very flat, and is immensely productive of wheat. The soil is adobe, a shining black loam, which makes an almost imperishable sun-baked brick, of which most of the houses are built, and then plastered. What are sometimes no ornament to the Californian landscape are here made as picturesque as possible, namely, the windmills working the artesian wells. Every house has one, and the numerous wands are prettily coloured, and, although looking rather gimcrack, they are far from ugly appendages to the widely spread-out buildings and gardens. The guide books dignify Stockton with the title of the City of Windmills, and Don Quixote would indeed have found here a rare field for glory.","T.S.

True, the central and western cities have had an advantage over those on the Atlantic seaboard, inasmuch as they were laid out and their sanitary arrangements planned at a time when modern ideas in these respects had taken root; and the municipal authorities of New York and Philadelphia might do worse than take a picnic to St. Louis and Kansas City and return home to act upon some of the lessons in roadmaking and kindred matters to be learnt there.","T.S.

Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.7934,-87.7898,T.S. Hudson,1882,"The approach to Chicago by rail is similar to that of many large commercial towns in England. Here and there are palatial residences, and well-treed suburbs and level roads border the railway. Nearer to the end of our ride, warehouses, distant masts of shipping, and high grain elevators crowded the view, there being every evidence that we were indeed entering a mighty mercantile city; and so it proved to be, for of all the inhabited places of the earth affording reminders of Jonah's gourd, Chicago is the most striking. Like many places of older growth, she has benefited in architectural and sanitary respects by what was a dire disaster at the time—a great conflagration. Here is a veritable Phœnix begotten of the ashes. The structures destroyed by the 1871 fire have been replaced by buildings that look to be everlasting, and the grand thoroughfares have the roadways paved with wooden blocks as in our own towns, and the sidewalks were, at the time of our going through, having their wooden planking rapidly superseded by flagging, the like of which could not be found in the world. Miles of it were already laid in State Street and the other magnificent streets parallel with, and intersecting at right angles, that splendid artery of traffic—huge blocks of stone, twelve feet by ten, and a foot thick, securely set, and needing no curbstone. The number and size of good shops is not equalled in the States. A book depôt which we patronised was a perfect library, and museum of books; its systematic arrangement and the scholastic attainments of the male and female attendants being nothing less than wonderful. It would have taken days to go through its well-contrived stands upon the ground floor and in the numerous galleries. The situation of Chicago is undoubtedly a super-advantage to it, and, with the exception that it is not one of the direct receiving ports of immigrants from across the seas, it has all the elements of a capital in a higher degree than New York, and will one day run her close in being practically the metropolis.","T.S.

Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",43.6615,-79.3955,T.S. Hudson,1882,"After a ride of three hours by rail, having passed the town of Hamilton about noon, we arrived at Toronto, a well-built city of nearly a hundred thousand inhabitants. One of its features is a long strip of an island lying out in the lake (Ontario) about two miles from the shore, where many of the Torontonians reside during the summer, leading a kind of “camping out” life. The lake-side situation of Toronto is effective, and the country around is highly cultivated and picturesque. An utter absence of paving or macadam causes all the streets to be perfect bogs in wet weather, and the Wooden sidewalks, although cleanly, and good to walk upon where not worn into holes, are not consistent with the pretensions of the architecture. A prominent part of the town is spoken of as the “Four Ations.” This appellation was explained to us by the fact of the corner buildings being respectively the Government House, Upper Canada College, a Scottish Presbyteyian Church, and—a public house; some local wag having immortalized them as Legislation, Education, Salvation, and D—ation. He must have been an irreverent and rabid teetotaler, or else he would have managed short of having recourse to profane language by making the fourth word Intoxication, or, better still, Liquid ation. We did not see more than the solid brick exterior of the educational institution mentioned; but were shown over the University of Toronto, a pleasing gray rubble building of true Norman architecture with bold facings of a lighter coloured stone, forming three sides of a quadrangle. The natural history museum and handsome well-stocked library were exceedingly well arranged. In the lecture hall we saw from the gallery some dozens of male students—and one female—grinding away at formidable-looking “papers,” which were handed in as fast as completed to the examiners sitting stern and awe-inspiring on the dais at the farther end of the room. The University building is surrounded by a well wooded park which contains an interesting monument erected by the students to their fellow volunteers who fell in repelling the Fenian raids of 1866. It is a massive stone column surmounted by a colossal statue of Britannia, and looks very handsome surrounded as it is by sombre-hued evergreens. Another example of pure Norman style that it would be difficult to find excelled among modern buildings in Europe, is St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church; in fact the public edifices of Toronto struck us as being decidedly above the average for a place of its size. Doubtless it will shortly mend its ways in the matter of pavements, when, with its handsome shade-trees and well laid-out plots, it will take that rank for beauty, which, as being second in population to Montreal, might be expected of it.","T.S.

The Americans say that the Buffalo people can hear the noise of the water-fall quite distinctly. I am quite prepared to believe it. However, an hour's journey by rail and then a quarter of an hour's sleigh ride will take you from Buffalo within sight of this, perhaps the grandest piece of scenery in the world. Words cannot describe it. You spend a couple of hours visiting every point of view. You are nailed, as it were, to the ground, feeling like a pigmy, awestruck in the presence of nature at her grandest. The snow was falling thickly, and though it made the view less clear, it added to the grandeur of the scene. I went down by the cable car to a level with the rapids and the place where poor Captain Webb was last seen alive; a presumptuous pigmy, he, to dare such waters as these. His widow keeps a little bazaar near the falls and sells souvenirs to the visitors. It was most thrilling to stand within touching distance of that great torrent of water, called the Niagara Falls, in distinction to the Horseshoe Falls, to hear the roar of it as it fell. The idea of force it gives one is tremendous. You stand and wonder how many ages it has been roaring on, what eyes besides your own have gazed awestruck at its mighty rushing, and wonder if the pigmies will ever do what they say they will; one day make those columns of water their servants to turn wheels at their bidding.","Max O'Rell, A Frenchman in America; Recollections of Men and Things (New York: Cassell Publishing Company, 1891), 74-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01319/01319.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The Russell is one of those huge babylonian hotels so common on the American continent, where unfortunately the cookery is not on a level with the architectural pretensions; but most of the leading Canadian politicians are boarding here while Parliament is sitting, and I am interested to see them. After visiting the beautiful library and other parts of the government buildings, I had the good luck to hear, in the House of Representatives, a debate between Mr. Chapleau, a minister and one of the leaders of the Conservatives now in office, and Mr. Laurier, one of the chiefs of the Opposition.

It possesses beautiful streets, avenues, and walks, and a fine square in the middle of which stands a remarkably fine monument. I am also grateful to this city for breaking the monotony of the eternal parallelograms with which the whole of the United States are built. My national vanity almost suggests to me that this town owes its gracefulness to its French origin.

The library contains 70,041 volumes, 14,626 unbound brochures, and 514 maps and charts. The University also possesses beautiful laboratories, museums, an astronomical
  observatory, collections, workshops of all sorts, a lecture hall capable of accommodating over two thousand people, art studios, etc., etc. Almost every school has a building of its own, so that the University is like a little busy town.

New Orleans,"New Orleans, Louisana",29.9471,-90.0893,Arthur Giles,1898,"New Orleans is the twelfth city of the States. In my “citizen” days it was the fourth, ranking after New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. It is the chief city of Louisiana, and the most southern metropolis. After Liverpool, it is the largest cotton market in the world, handling 2,000,000 bales annually, and is the third of American seaports. The population is about the same as Edinburgh, 242,039 (winter, 260,000), the percentage of nationalities being —Anglo-American, 18 per cent.; French, 17; German, 15; Irish, 14; Italian, 8; Spanish, 2.3; and 25 per cent. coloured, or 177,376 white and 14,663 coloured. Baton Rouge, a quaint old place 89 miles up the river, with a population of 10,478, is the State capital In latitude 29.56 and longitude 90.4 w., New Orleans is 106 to 108 miles from the Delta of the Mississippi, in the Gulf of Mexico, and is one of the most picturesque and interesting cities in America owing to the survival of the buildings, manners, and customs of the original French and Spanish. G. W. Cable describes it as “a city of villas and cottages, of umbrageous gardens intersected by 470 miles of unpaved streets shaded by forest trees, haunted by song-birds, fragrant with a wealth of flowers that never fails a day in the year, and abundant in season with fruit—the fig, plum, pomegranate, and orange.” The Creoles are “a handsome, graceful, and intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type.” Its history begins with the mention of the Mississippi being traversed by white men (Spaniards) in 1536, then in 1539–41–42–43; with the settlement of French in 1699, the city being founded by Bienville in 1718, and passing under Spanish domination 1764–1801. It was then Americanised by purchase, 1803; besieged in 1812 by the British, being the scene of battle in 1815, and taken in the Civil War in 1862. Its State was admitted to the Union in 1812. There are five parks, four libraries, four theatres, eighty public or private schools, fifty institutions (of which eleven are charitable), twelve insurance companies, ten railroads, twelve steamboat lines, thirty-four sea-going. Its exports are £248,000,000; imports, £50,000,000; bank capital, £2,000,000; and its valuation in 1894, £28,000,000; manufactures, £12,000,000; commerce, £88,000,000; revenue, £600,000; debt, £3,100,000 (steadily if slowly disappearing). There are twelve miles of water front. Since the '30's, when the city bade fair to reach if not outshine New York, there has not been such a spirit of emulation and enterprise as there is now. Public and private improvements are being carried out on a liberal scale. The conversion of 186 miles of streets into beautiful avenues, and transforming the car service from horse to electric, is costing £1,000,000,—(one system was the first n the States)—and all around the least changeable is all change.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 125-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Brooklyn,"Brooklyn, New York",40.6771,-73.9448,Arthur Giles,1898,"A stranger tourist of the later past would have considered Brooklyn a part of New York, separated as it was only by a bridge, but one of great magnitude and unique completeness for all kinds of vehicular as well as for pedestrian traffic. It is only now, however, at the end of 1897, that it is a part of New York included in the temporary term of Greater New York. This new district has until now been the fourth city of the United States in size and industrial interest, with 806,343 inhabitants in 1890. It is the “City of Churches,” and the “Dormitory of New York,” owing to so many city business men living there. It covers an area of 24 square miles, threaded with electric cars, and has five elevated railways within it, and three railway stations. The beautiful Prospect Park is the chief attraction for strangers. It has 550 acres, the lake being 60 acres in extent.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 22.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

In 1890 it had 261,353, having increased 60 per cent. in the last decade. Its manufactures employ 50,000 hands, and are of the annual value of £21,100,000, while its iron and steel works are valued at £5,000,000. It is one of the chief ship-building cities. The streets are broad and well paved, with green lawns and squares and numerous trees, by which it has acquired the name of the “Forest City.” Its chief business blocks are substantial, and the public buildings handsome. The Garfield Memorial, which cost £26,000, and is 165 feet high, is perhaps the most beautiful monument of the kind. It is in Lake View Cemetery, at the further end of Euclid Avenue, one of the extremely beautiful residence streets in America, with handsome houses surrounded by pleasant grounds and trees.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 32-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.8674,-87.6588,Arthur Giles,1898,"Chicago is, as all the world knows, the second city in the United States, with a population, in 1890, of 1,099,850. It has a water front on Lake Michigan of 22 miles. Its streets are wide and straight, and its buildings in the business quarter so lofty as to be famous. To name the various public halls, art, educational, literary, and other institutes, municipal and commercial buildings, and state edifices, is to enumerate every kind of structure in any city except a Cathedral, although it has a Bishop. 600 students entered its University in 1892. Its public parks, embracing 1795 acres, form a green band round the city, and afford a continuous drive of 37 miles. Lake Shore Drive, Michigan Boulevard, and Drexel Boulevard, are fine residence streets, with tasteful houses and ornamental gardens. I must not omit to mention the Pullman car works, which constitute a model little town of 11,000 inhabitants, there being five or six thousand operatives in the works. The famous stock yards had no interest for me. Instead, I paid a visit to the University, where my friend Professor Smith was, and I also left my card of introduction at the Bishop of Chicago's City rooms. The trade of Chicago is second only to New York, and in 1892 was of 308 millions sterling value, its manufactures being 117 millions. 21,123 vessels entered or cleared Chicago in 1892, being 25 per cent. above New York. The Illinois Steel Co., of which Mr. W. R. Stirling, of the Brotherhood Council, was the vice-president, employs twelve thousand men, and the M'Cormick Company produces 120,000 harvesting machines annually. The many enormously tall edifices are really steel-framed buildings veneered with stone and brick, the lower ornamental walls being often filled in last. Their height is now limited to 150 feet. The rapid running elevators make the upper stories as accessible as the ground ones. I found it quite easy to have my hair cut twenty stories up without finding it standing on end. The airiness of the position was refreshing. Like New York, Chicago is not its own State capital, that being Springfield, Illinois, a town of only 25,000 inhabitants.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 38-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",43.6563,-79.3791,Arthur Giles,1898,"This episode and the observation of so much that was British led me to feel myself more at home. Throughout the whole day's experience of place and people I felt I was no longer in the United States, but in a British colony, the visible representations of home relations being the postman, the police, and the Queen Victoria coinage. Shops and places of business are also in their style more English. The ladies are less American in caste and manner, and seem just those we meet in London or Edinburgh thoroughfares. The Queen City, as Toronto is called, is the second in Canada, the population being 181,220. It extends eight miles along the lake, the buildings being substantial and sometimes handsome. The spire of St. James's Cathedral is 316 feet high, and was once the highest in America. At the Queen's Park, a wooded area of 40 acres, stands the massive buildings of the Provincial Parliament, costing £300,000, and the University of Toronto, the finest composition of college architecture in the Western Hemisphere. The main building, designed by Cumberland & Storm, costing £100,000, was burnt in 1890, but has been rebuilt, the architect of the restored building being Mr. Dick, once of Edinburgh, who hospitably entertained me as a friend of Mr. Hippolyte Blanc, R.S.A., and drove me round a good part of the city. 1300 students attend the University and College, and 300 that of Trinity College, an Anglican University.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 42-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Ottawa,"Ottawa, Ontario",45.42,-75.6965,Arthur Giles,1898,"Ottawa was only incorporated as a city in 1854, when it had but 10,000 inhabitants. It was made the capital by the Queen's selection of it as the official capital, in order to end the conflicting claims of Montreal, Quebec, Kingston, and Toronto. Like Washington it has thus had the opportunity to make itself worthy of the position to which it had been raised, and is already one of the handsomest and best kept cities of the Dominion. Like its States sister, too, it is the scientific centre of the country, with the headquarters of the chief scientific societies and collections, while the presence of the Governor-General constitutes it a natural focus of cultivated and fashionable society. The first settler established himself in 1800 on the opposite side of the river—the district now called Hull, with 11,265 inhabitants. Twenty years after he transferred his claim on the subsequently called “Bytown” side—the original name of Ottawa until it became a city. The inhabitants of Ottawa numbered 44,154 in 1891, and must now have risen to 50,000. They are nearly equally divided between French and British and Protestants and Roman Catholics. The Rideau and Chaudière Falls close to the city are very picturesque. The Rideau descends by six locks into the Ottawa River, picturesquely situated beside two bridges at acute angles.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 42-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America

It is 33 miles long, and from ¾ to 3 miles wide, dotted with 222 pretty islands.

Its normal population, which is 12,000, is doubled in July and August, when the wealth of the United States is there displayed. Political, legal, and banking conventions are popular. At the battle of Saratoga, in 1777, Sir John Burgoyne surrendered to the Americans. The hotels accommodate 20,000 visitors. One has a dining-room 275 feet long.

Its wide, finely laid out, asphalted streets, leafy squares and circles (some adorned with statues) and its shade tree avenues bearing names of different states, presents a system which deserves the name of city gardening. Pennsylvania Avenue, stretching a distance of a mile and a third, runs from the Capitol to the White House. The Capitol is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, 751 feet in length, and from 121 to 324 feet wide. The main edifice is sandstone, painted white, but the two wings are white marble. It occupies an area of 3½ acres. The park in which it stands is about 50 acres in extent. Its style is Classic, with Corinthian details. Opposite the central portico on the east side is a colossal statue of George Washington, and on the broad steps in front of the main doorway the inauguration of the Presidents of the United States takes place. The west side, upon which the city has extended, is approached by broad flights of steps, with a fine marble terrace. Sculpture and painting has contributed to perpetuate at the Capitol the political and historical events of the nation. The Hall of Representatives measures 139 feet by 93 feet, and is 36 feet high. There are desks for 352 members and 4 delegates. The size of the Senate Chamber is only 113 feet by 80 feet, the height being the same as the other chamber. It is more ornate than the Hall of Representatives. There are, of course, many Government buildings which were open to us, but the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the manufacture of paper money and bonds, and the Treasury Building, with its hundreds of millions of dollars in coin, appealed to the common interest of everyone.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 73-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

It has 30 miles of water front on its two rivers, and is the headquarters of two great railway systems. Its steamers ply to various ports in the world. The names of William Penn and Benjamin Franklin are bound up with its history, and it is the scene of most important official steps, such as the Assembly of the first Continental (American) Congress, in 1774; the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776; the promulgation of the Constitution in 1787; and the place of assembly for Congress up till 1797. I saw in the Market Place the huge statue of Penn, 37 feet in height, which has now been raised to the tower of the New City Hall, 510 feet high. The huge pile covers a greater area than any other American building, being 4½ acres, compared with Washington Capitol, with 3½ acres. It has a granite basement story and white marble superstructure, and has taken twenty years to build. Its style is modified French Renaissance, and the building contains 750 rooms. The Council Chamber and municipal offices are on the first floor. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania occupies the third floor. Opposite the City Hall is the most handsome Broad Street Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in the same square stands the Masonic Temple, a great granite structure in the Norman style, costing £300,000, with tower 250 feet high. The lodge rooms are in seven different styles—Egyptian, Ionic, Corinthian, Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, and Oriental. The universally known Wanamaker's Store—the Bon Marché , Whiteley's, Jenner's, or Cranston's of Philadelphia—with 4500 employees, is quite near. Through this I had the privilege of being taken, dining there. The United States Mint, in Chestnut Street (which is the Princes Street of the City), is a white marble building of immense internal interest. The officials were magnanimously courteous, and some bestowed great attention upon me as a Great Britainer by pointing out things they knew would specially interest me. I was able from a very limited numismatic knowledge to correct a misplacement of a British coin in the unique collection, a hint they received with courtly deference. The Post Office is a large granite building in the Renaissance style, and cost £1,000,000. It contains other Federal offices, and the United States Courts. Independence Hall, the old State House, is only a brick edifice, erected 1729–34, but is perhaps the most interesting building in the States. It contains the famous Liberty Bell, the first rung in the United States after the Declaration of Independence, adopted in that
  Hall. It cracked in 1835, and has been silent half a century (since 1843). Originally cast in England, it was recast in Philadelphia. The first American flag—thirteen stars and thirteen stripes—was made at No. 239 Arch Street.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 77-80.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",42.3562,-71.0651,Arthur Giles,1898,"Albany may be the Edinburgh of the United States because of its political influence and relations to the State of New York, but Boston has the nearer resemblance to it in the eye of the tourist and visitor of taste and culture. Although not possessing the commanding dignity of a castle upon a picturesque eminence, it has a beautifully laid out park in the very heart of the city somewhat relative as Princes Street is to the rest of the town. Boston Common, as the park is called, occupies 48 acres, shaded by fine elms and other trees, and, on account of its position near historic buildings and ground, it is entwined with the interests and affections of the surrounding population. There are also other parks of some importance. The city is perhaps the wealthiest in America in proportion to population. Its valuation in 1892 was £188,200,000. There are some public buildings of great interest and importance, and scientific, literary, and educational institutes, that indicate the higher culture of the residenters. Among a group of fine structures in a well-exposed area is the new Public Library, a dignified and imposing edifice, vis-à-vis to the noble Trinity Church, of which the late Bishop Phillips Brooks was rector, and where he preached the opening charge to the Brotherhood on the occasion of the Brotherhood Convention of 1892. Faneuil Hall, styled “the Cradle of American Liberty,” was the place of assembly of that Convention. Boston Public Library is known to be the largest of its kind in the world. It had 600,000 volumes in 1891, the circulation being 1,812,106 books in the year.

Its trade by river and rail is very important, and it has some fine Government and public buildings, and a most successfully designed fountain in a square, which forms the business centre from which radiate many tramway lines.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 140-1.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

In Scotland, Carnegie libraries have increased our knowledge of Pittsburg, but although literary light and light literature are the outcome of many such munificent gifts, the idea of the city is but iron and smoke; perfectly true in respect of the lower lying parts, but not altogether the character of its residential districts, which are on the high lands above the Monongahela and Alleghany rivers and the Ohio river, when we include the sister city of Alleghany, which has a separaten government, but is related to Pittsburg. A Greater New York may some day be followed by a Greater Pittsburg that would represent, but in increased ratio, 344,000 inhabitants instead of only 238,617, Alleghany having 105,387.","Arthur Giles, Across Western Waves and Home in a Royal Capital: America for Modern Athenians, Modern Athens for Americans; A Personal Narrative in Tour and Time (London: Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., 1898), 143.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
San Francisco,"San Francisco, California",37.7797,-122.4308,Charles Finch Dowsett,1890,"Some of the hills in San Francisco are very steep, and the first sensation in riding on the outside front seat, while going full speed down a sharp declivity, is certainly novel, with no apparent motive power, and no apparent means of stopping. The speed, of course, is always the same, whether up or down hill, or on level ground. Telegraph Hill is 394 feet high, Clay Street Hill 376 feet, and Russian Hill 360 feet. A San Francisco Sunday is painful to one accustomed to our English ways; travelling in every form, and buying and selling are very prevalent. The Y.M.C.A. have a large building there, and get large meetings. I attended one gathering, which I addressed shortly. San Francisco is described as having “the mildest and most equable climate known to any large city in the world.” January is the coldest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 50°. September is the hottest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 58°. Thus only 8° difference between the coldest and warmest months, and the average for the whole year is 54°. San Francisco has a population of about 300,000 (including some 40,000 Chinese), is the principal city of the State of California, and the principal commercial centre on the Pacific coast.","Charles Finch Dowsett, A Start in Life; A Journey Across America; Fruit Farming in California (London: Dowsett & Co, 1891), 44-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/14340/14340.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Omaha,"Omaha, Nebraska",41.2537,-95.9401,Willard W. Glazier,1876,"Omaha lies on the eastern boundary of Nebraska, opposite Council Bluffs, on the western bank of the Missouri River, a turbulent stream, which is never satisfied with its position, but is constantly shifting and changing, and making for itself new channels. A bottom land about three miles wide stretches out between Omaha and Council Bluffs, and through this the Missouri rolls, a swift, muddy stream, slowly but surely carrying the Rocky Mountains down to the Mississippi, which, in its turn, deposits them in the Gulf of Mexico, and helps to extend our Gulf coast. The Missouri vibrates like a pendulum, from one side of this bottom land to the other; now being near one city, and then near the other. At the period of my visit its current washed the front of Omaha, leaving Council Bluffs some distance off on the opposite side; but it was already beginning its backward swing. Thus the boundary line between Nebraska and Iowa is being continually shifted, and one State is augmented in territory at the expense of the other. Omaha is built in part upon the low bottom lands which border the river, and which may at any time be menaced by the swollen and angry stream, unless precautions are taken, in the building of high and substantial stone levees along the river front. The town lies also in part upon the table lands beyond, and is extending to the bluffs which rise still further away. Its business is chiefly confined to the lower portion, where magnificent blocks attest the prosperity of the city. Streets of substantial dwellings, and numerous most elegant private residences, with large and hand somely ornamented grounds, are discovered as one passes through the city. A striking edifice, of Cincinnati free-stone, four stories high, is occupied as a Post Office and Court House. Its High School building is one of the finest in the country. When the State Government was, in 1866, removed from Omaha to Lincoln, the Legislature donated the Square and Capitol Building at the former place for High School purposes. The old Capitol was demolished, and a magnificent school building erected on its site, at a cost of $250,000, while other fine school edifices, aggregating in cost about $150,000 more, were erected in other sections of the city. The High School building is on the summit of a hill, over-looking a large extent of country, and has a spire one hundred and eighty-five feet high. The Depot of the Union Pacific Railroad is also a noteworthy edifice.","Willard W.

Pittsburg,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",40.4411,-79.9974,Willard W. Glazier,1876,"In truth, Pittsburg is a smoky, dismal city, at her best. At her worst, nothing darker, dingier or more dispiriting can be imagined. The city is in the heart of the soft coal region; and the smoke from her dwellings, stores, factories, foundries and steamboats, uniting, settles in a cloud over the narrow valley in which she is built, until the very sun looks coppery through the sooty haze. According to a circular of the Pittsburg Board of Trade, about twenty per cent., or one-fifth, of all the coal used in the factories and dwellings of the city escapes into the air in the form of smoke, being the finer and lighter particles of carbon of the coal, which, set free by fire, escapes unconsumed with the gases. The consequences of several thousand bushels of coal in the air at one and the same time may be imagined. But her inhabitants do not seem to mind it; and the doctors hold that this smoke, from the carbon, sulphur and iodine contained in it, is highly favorable to lung and cutaneous diseases, and is the sure death of malaria and its attendant fevers. And certainly, whatever the cause may be, Pittsburg is one of the healthiest cities in the United States. Her inhabitants are all too busy to reflect upon the inconvenience or uncomeliness of this smoke. Work is the object of life with them. It occupies them from morning until night, from the cradle to the grave, only on Sundays, when, for the most part, the furnaces are idle, and the forges are silent. For Pittsburg, settled by Irish-Scotch Presbyterians, is a great Sunday-keeping day. Save on this day her business men do not stop for rest or recreation, nor do they “retire” from business. They die with the harness on, and die, perhaps, all the sooner for having worn it so continuously and so long. Pittsburg is not a beautiful city. That stands to reason, with the heavy pall of smoke which constantly overhangs her. But she lacks beauty in other respects. She is substantially and compactly built, and contains some handsome edifices; but she lacks the architectural magnificence of some of her sister cities; while her suburbs present all that is unsightly and forbidding in appearance, the original beauties of nature having been ruthlessly sacrificed to utility. Pittsburg is situated in western Pennsylvania, in a narrow valley at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, and at the head of the Ohio, and is surrounded by hills rising to the height of four or five hundred feet. These hills once possessed rounded outlines, with sufficient exceptional abruptness to lend them variety and picturesqueness. But they have been leveled down, cut into, sliced off, and ruthlessly marred and mutilated, until not a trace of their original outlines remain. Great black coal cars crawl up and down their sides, and plunge into unexpected and mysterious openings, their sudden disappearance lending, even in daylight, an air of mystery and diablerie to the region. Railroad tracks gridiron the ground everywhere, debris of all sorts lies in heaps, and is scattered over the earth, and huts and hovels are perched here and there, in every available spot.","Willard W.

Portland,"Portland, Maine",43.661,-70.2841,Willard W. Glazier,1876,"The approach to Portland is more beautiful, even, than that to New York. The city is built upon a small peninsula rising out of Casco Bay, to a mean central elevation of more than one hundred feet. This peninsula projects from the main land in a northeast direction, and is about three miles long, by an average breadth of three-fourths of a mile. An arm of the Bay, called Fore River, divides it on the south from Cape Elizabeth, and forms an inner harbor of more than six hundred acres in extent, and with an average depth, at high water, of thirty feet. Vessels of the largest size can anchor in the main harbor, in forty feet of water at low tide. The waters of the Back Cove separate it on the north from the shores of Deering, and form another inner basin, of large extent and considerable depth. At the northeasternmost extremity of the Neck, Munjoy Hill rises to a height of one hundred and sixty-one feet, and commands a beautiful view of the city, bay, adjacent islands and the ocean beyond. At the southwestern extremity is Bramhall's Hill, rising to one hundred and seventy-five feet, and commanding city, bay, forests, fields, villages and mountains. The land sinks somewhat between these two elevations, but its lowest point still rises fiftyseven feet above high tide. The elevation of its site, and the beauty of its scenery and surroundings, are fast attracting the attention of tourists, and drawing to the city hosts of summer visitors. The peninsula is covered with a network of streets and lanes, containing an aggregate length of fifty miles, while it has thirty wharves to accommodate the commerce of the port. Congress street, the main thoroughfare of the city, is three miles in length, and extends from Bramhall to Munjoy. Running parallel to it for a part of its length, on the southern slope, are Middle street, a business street, devoted principally to the wholesale and retail trade; Fore street, the ancient water street of the city, but now devoted to miscellaneous trade; and Commercial street, which commands the harbor, and is principally devoted to large wholesale business. At the west end there are other streets between Congress and Commercial, including Spring, Danforth and York. Cumberland, Oxford, supplemented on its western end by Portland, Lincoln, along the shore of Back Cove, also supplemented on its western end by Kennebec street, are on the northern slope of Congress street. The cross streets are numerous. India street, at the eastern end, was the early site of population and business; Franklin and Beal streets are the only ones running straight across the peninsula, from water to water; Exchange street, devoted to banks, brokers' offices and insurance agencies, and High and State streets, occupied by private residences, are the principal ones. There is partially completed around the entire city a Marginal Way, one hundred feet in width, and nearly five miles in length.","Willard W.

Reading,"Reading, Pennsylvania",40.3338,-75.932,Willard W. Glazier,1876,"The manufacturing interests of Reading are second to no city of like population in the United States; while it is the third city in Pennsylvania in its manufactures, Pittsburg and Philadelphia alone exceeding it. Among these manufactures the working of iron holds the first rank. Much of the ore is obtained from Penn's Mountain, on the east of the town. Rolling mills, machine shops, car shops, furnaces, foundries, cotton mills and hat factories, from their number and extent, establish beyond question the claim of Reading to be considered one of the first manufacturing towns of America. The shops of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad alone employ two thousand men. From an early hour in the morning the eastern bank of the Schuylkill rings out the discordant music of numberless factories, betokening the enterprise of her productive industries. Reading has, at the present time, a population numbering not far from fifty thousand. It is delightfully situated on an elevated and ascending plain, which rises to the eastward into Penn's Mountain, and to the southward into the Neversink Mountain. The city is abundantly supplied with pure water, by streams flowing from these mountains. It is surrounded by a rich farming country, which looks to it for supplies. The streets cross each other at right angles, and the chief hotels and stores are built around Penn's Square, which occupies the centre of the city. It contains thirty-one churches, most prominent among which is Trinity, German Lutheran, an antique building with a spire two hundred and ten feet in height. Christ Church, Episcopal, is a handsome Gothic edifice of more recent date, and with a spire nearly as high. The Grand Opera House and Mishler's Academy of Music furnish amusements for the pleasure-seekers of the city.","Willard W.

Providence,"Providence, Rhode Island",41.8231,-71.4126,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"Providence is the second city of New England in respect to wealth and population. It is pleasantly located at the head of Narragansett Bay, thirty-five miles from the ocean. Its commercial advantages are unsurpassed, and as a manufacturing town it ranks among the first in the Atlantic States. The city is divided into two unequal portions by a narrow arm of the Bay, which terminates near the geographical centre of the town, in a beautiful elliptical sheet of water, about one mile in circumference, called the cove, or basin. This basin is inclosed by a handsome granite wall, capped by a substantial and ornamental iron fence, and is surrounded by a green about eighty feet in width, filled with a variety of beautiful and thrifty shade trees. The eastern portion of the city rises from the water, in some places gradually, in others quite abruptly, to the height of more than two hundred feet. This elevated land is occupied by elegant private mansions surrounded with numerous shade trees and ornamental gardens, making one of the most delightful and desirable places for residence to be found in any city. The western portion of the city rises very gradually until it reaches an elevation of about seventy-five feet, when it spreads out into a level plain, extending a considerable distance to the southwest. The northern portion, recently annexed to the city, is more sparsely populated, and portions of it are quite rural in appearance and abounding in hills, numerous springs and small streams of water. Providence is about forty-three miles from Boston, the same distance from Worcester, ninety miles from Hartford, fifty miles from Stonington, and twenty miles from Fall River, with each of which places it is connected by numerous daily trains. It also has railroad connections with New Bedford and southern Massachusetts, with Fitchburg, and thence with Vermont and New Hampshire. There is now in process of construction another route to Northern Connecticut, Springfield and the west. It is also closely connected with Newport, and other places on Narragansett Bay, by steamboats. Brown University is one of the distinguishing features of Providence, and, as an institution of learning, stands in the front rank of American colleges.","Willard W.

Richmond,"Richmond, Virginia",37.5407,-77.4357,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"Yet one who views Richmond at the present day, unbiased by the untoward circumstances which threw their baleful influence over us, will see much to admire in and about the city. It is situated on the north bank of the James River, about one hundred miles by water from Chesapeake Bay, and the same distance a little west of south of Washington. It is built upon several eminences, the principal ones being Shockoe and Richmond hills, separated by Shockoe Creek. Like so many other Southern cities, its residences are surrounded by gardens, in which are grass plots, shrubbery and flowers; and in the business quarter are many substantial edifices....The city is regularly laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles. Those parallel with the river are named alphabetically, A street being on the river. The cross streets are named numerically. The principal thoroughfare is Main or E street, which is the centre of business. The fashionable quarter is on Shockoe Hill, in the western part of the city, where are also the chief public edifices. The Penitentiary is in the western suburbs facing the river, and is a massive structure three hundred feet long and one hundred and ten feet deep. The Almshouse is one of the finest buildings in the city. There are a large number of churches, thirteen colleges, and an orphan asylum. Five bridges across the James River connect it with Spring Hill and Manchester, the latter a pretty town containing two cotton mills. The population of Richmond, by the census of 1880, was 63,803, which showed an increase of more than ten thousand persons in ten years. Unlike Charleston, S. C., it is surrounded by a populous rural region, whose products find a market here, and whose population look largely to the city for their supplies. It will never attain the commercial consequence of Savannah or of Norfolk, but as the centre of the tobacco region, and the seat of large manufacturing interests, it will always possess a certain importance and prosperity.","Willard W.

Pleasantly situated on the Connecticut River, and enjoying now the advantage of exclusive legislation for the State, Hartford is destined to become one of the most important cities of New England. Authors, artists and publishers have ever found Hartford a fruitful field for the development of brains and enterprise. It is, perhaps, not exaggeration to say that in no other city of the United States of the same size is there so large a proportion of the population devoted to literature. The American and Hartford Publishing Companies, the firms of Burr, Scranton, Worthington, Dustin, Gilman and Company, and many others of less note, are located here. The new State House, now in process of erection, is destined to be one of the finest buildings in the country. The site commands a view of the city and its surroundings for many miles. Among the objects of interest to be found here are the residence of “Mark Twain” and the State Insane Asylum. “Mark's” house is at the end of Farmington avenue, on a little eminence, at the foot of which flows a nameless stream. Its style of construction is so unlike the average house that it has won for itself the characteristic title of “The None Such.”","Willard W.

Lancaster,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",40.0404,-76.3076,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"Eastern Pennsylvania is beyond question the finest section of the State: and the tourist who sojourns at Bryn Mawr, Downingtown, Bird-in-Hand, and many of their sister villages, will see abundant evidences of the wealth and prosperity of an industrious people. The country is sufficiently rolling to be picturesque, without any of the ruggedness which characterizes the central and western portions of the State. Sometimes from the car windows the roofs and spires of several villages may be seen in different directions, while substantial farmhouses with their commodious out-buildings, are on every hand. The land is brought to a high state of cultivation, and the entire region seems almost like an extensive park. Lancaster, the county-seat of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is situated on the Conestoga River, seventy-three miles from Philadelphia. This river, which is a tributary of the Susquehanna, is made navigable by nine locks and slack-water pools, from Lancaster to its mouth at Safe Harbor, eighteen miles distant. Considerable trade is brought to the city by its means; while Tidewater Canal opens up navigable communication to Baltimore, by way of Port Deposit. Lancaster was, from 1799 to 1812, the seat of the State government; it was incorporated in 1818, and was at one time the principal inland town of Pennsylvania. The oldest turnpike in the United States terminates at Lancaster, connecting that city with Philadelphia. It has now something more than twenty-five thousand inhabitants, largely descended from the early Dutch settlers, whose names are still borne, and whose language, corrupted into “Pennsylvania Dutch,” is still a most familiar one in that region. The city is principally a manufacturing one, producing locomotives, axes, carriages and cotton goods, and being particularly celebrated for its rifles. It has many fine buildings, both public and private. The Court House and County Prison will both attract attention, the former being in the Corinthian and the latter in the Norman style of architecture. Fulton Hall, near the Market-place, is a large edifice used for public assemblies. Franklin and Marshall College, organized in 1853 by the union of Marshall College with the old Franklin College, founded in 1787, is found on James street, and possesses a library of thirteen thousand volumes.

Milwaukee,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",43.0379,-87.9137,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"A rival of Chicago, Milwaukee shares with that city the commerce of the lakes, and is connected by steamboats with many points on the opposite side of Lake Michigan and with more distant ports. She is the lake terminus of a large number of railroads which drain an agricultural region of great extent and fertility; while her nearness to the copper mines of Lake Superior and the inexhaustible iron mines distant but from forty to fifty miles to the northward, contribute to make her a manufacturing centre. A single establishment for the manufacture of railroad iron was established, at a cost of a million of dollars. She has other iron works, and manufactures machinery, agricultural implements, car wheels and steam boilers, large quantities of tobacco and cigars; furnishes the Northwest with furniture, and has extensive pork packing establishments, while the products of her flouring mills and lager beer breweries find markets in every quarter of the United States, and have a reputation all their own. The rolling mill of the North Chicago Rolling Mill Company is one of the most extensive in the West...Milwaukee is known as the “Cream City of the Lakes,” this name being derived from the cream-colored brick of which many of the buildings are constructed. It gives to the streets a peculiarly light and cheerful aspect. The whole architectural appearance of the city is one of primness rather than of grandeur, which might not inappropriately suggest for it the name of the “Quaker City of the West.” The residence streets are shaded by avenues of trees, which add to the cheerful beauty of the town. The principal hotels and retail stores are found upon East Water street, Wisconsin street and Second avenue, which are all three wide and handsome thoroughfares. The United States Custom House stands on the corner of Wisconsin and Milwaukee streets, and is the finest public building in the city. It is of Athens stone, and contains the Post Office and United States Courts. The County Court House is also a striking edifice. The Opera House, used for theatrical purposes, is worthy of mention; while the Academy of Music, which was erected in 1864, by the German Musical Society, at a cost of $65,000, has an elegant auditorium, seating two thousand three hundred persons...No one who visits Milwaukee can fail to be struck with the semi-foreign appearance of the city. Breweries are multiplied throughout its streets, lager beer saloons abound, beer gardens, with their flowers and music and cleanly arbor-shaded tables, attract the tired and thirsty in various quarters. German music halls, gasthausen, and restaurants are found everywhere, and German signs are manifest over many doors. One hears German spoken upon the streets quite as often as English, and Teuton influence upon the political and social life of the city is everywhere seen and felt. Germans constitute nearly onehalf the entire population of Milwaukee, and have impressed their character upon the people and the city itself in other ways than socially. Steady-going plodders, with their love for music and flowers, they have yet no keen taste for display, and every time choose the substantial rather than the ornamental. Milwaukee is a sort of rendezvous for the Scandinavian emigrants, who are pouring in like a mighty tide to fill up the States of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Danes and Swedes, and especially Norwegians, stop here, and it may be, linger for a longer or shorter period, before they strike out into the, to them, unknown country which is to be their future home. Domestic service is largely supplied by the Norwegians, who prove themselves honest, industrious and capable.","Willard W.

In our short journey from New York we passed over broad, level meadows, bearing some resemblance to a western prairie. The Passaic and the Hackensack rivers traverse these prairie-like meadows, while rising abruptly in the distance you behold the historic Bergen Heights. Disembarking at the conveniently located Market Street Depot, we sought and found a temporary home, and then lost no time in gratifying our native curiosity, by exploring the city and learning something of its origin and history. Newark is over two hundred years old, and yet is regularly laid out; its wide and well paved streets are adorned and shaded with grand old elms—some of them coeval with the founding of the city. Its chief business thoroughfare, Broad street, running north and south through the central part of the city, has many fine business blocks, and a finer avenue cannot be found than the south end of Broad street, lined with wide-spreading elms, and extending, apparently, into infinitude. One peculiarity that absorbed my attention, was the vast number of manufacturing establishments here, located, for the most part, outside of
  the central streets, and these are doubtless the source of her prosperity.","Willard W.

A novel sight, in my judgment, is a multitude of oyster plantations staked out in such a manner as to show the proprietor of each particular section his exact limit or boundary. To those of my readers who are familiar with hop-growing regions, I would say that an oyster farm is not unlike a hop field which seems to have been suddenly inundated by water, leaving only the tops of the poles 17 above the surface. Oyster raising is one of the leading features of New Haven enterprise, and the Fair Haven oysters, in particular, are regarded among the best that are cultivated on the Atlantic coast. On our return trip up the harbor the tide was going out, and as the water was extremely shallow in many places, and also very clear, we could see oysters and their less palatable neighbors, clams, in great abundance.","Willard W.

Here are the retail stores, public buildings, churches and private residences. The streets in the central portions of the city cross one another at right angles, but become irregular as they approach the boundaries. They are graded and paved and lighted by gas. Two bridges connect the opposite shores of the river, and horse cars traverse all sections of the city. Its general appearance is pleasing in the extreme. Many of the houses are built of blue limestone, which is found underlying one of the terraces in great quantities. The State Capitol building is now in process of construction, and will, when completed, be a very handsome edifice, occupying an entire square. The United States Custom House, an opera house, a large number of handsome churches, and several public school buildings are among the objects worthy of note in the city. Although Saint Paul is settled largely by people from New England and New York State, the Roman Catholics still hold an important place in the city. The first to take possession of the spot, they will be the last to relax their hold. They have a number of large and handsomely finished church edifices, and have established an orphan asylum.

The streets are lined with trees, while streams of running water course down each side of every street, being brought from the neighboring mountains, ten thousand feet high, furnishing a pure water supply, and irrigating the gardens. Almost every lot has an orchard of pear, apple, plum, apricot, and peach trees, and Utah furnishes large quantities of fresh and dried fruit for the eastern markets. Apricots, which in the east are almost unknown, sometimes grow as large as eastern peaches, from six to eight inches in circumference. Locust, maple and box-elder are the favorite shade trees, and these grow luxuriantly. When, however, their roots strike soil from which the alkali has not yet been washed, their leaves turn from a dark green to a sickly yellow. But irrigation washes out this alkali, and the trouble from it grows less every year. Salt Lake City is divided into twenty wards, nearly every one of which has a square. Every ward has its master, who superintends the public improvements, and sees that every man does his share without shirking. The houses are generally of adobe (sundried bricks), though a few of the newer business blocks are handsome and commodious stone structures. Most of the dwelling houses are small, and but a single story in height, having separate entrances when there is more than one wife in the family. The city is not an imposing one. The wide streets, large grounds around each dwelling, and low, small houses, give it more the appearance of an overgrown village than that of a city. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the plan upon which it is built secures to its inhabitants the maximum of comfort, health and cleanliness. There are no narrow and stifling streets, overshadowed by tall buildings; no dirty alleys; no immense crime and pestilence-breeding tenement houses. Each little dwelling has its garden and orchard, securing to each family the blessings of fresh vegetables and fruit, and making each in a measure self-dependent. The air is pure, blowing down the valley from the mountain heights; and no foul vapors from half protected sewers or reeking courts poison it. The chief business thoroughfares are Main and Temple streets. The former is entirely devoted to trade, while church edifices are found in the latter. The Tabernacle is, of course, the most prominent object which meets the eye of the traveler as he arrives in Salt Lake City, standing out, as it does, in all its huge proportions, surrounded by the tiny homes of the people. It is on Temple street, in the heart of the city, and is entirely without architectural beauty, its predominant features being its hugeness and its ugliness. It is an enormous wooden structure, oval in form, with an immense dome-like roof, supported by forty-six sandstone pillars. It will seat fifteen thousand persons, and is used for the services of the church, lectures and public gatherings. It contains one of the largest organs in America. It is inclosed within a high wall, and a little to the east of it, within the same inclosure, are the foundations of a new temple, estimated to cost ten millions of dollars, but which will not probably be finished for many years to come. An inferior adobe building, also within the walls, is the celebrated Endowment House, where are performed those sacred and mysterious rites of the Mormon Church which no Gentile may look upon, and where the Saints are sealed to their polygamous wives.","Willard W.

San Francisco,"San Francisco, California",37.7732,-122.4297,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"San Francisco is on a peninsula which extends between the bay of that name and the ocean. Its site is nothing more than a collection of sand hills, which, before the building of the city, were continually changing their positions. The peninsula is thirty miles long and six wide, across the city, which stands on the eastern or inner slope. San Francisco Bay is unsurpassed in the world, except by Puget Sound, in Washington Territory, for size, depth, ease of entrance and security. The entrance to the bay is through a passage five miles in length and about two in width, with its shallowest depth about thirty feet at low tide. Rocks rise almost perpendicularly on the northern side of the entrance, to a height of three thousand feet. A lighthouse is placed on one of 29 these, at Point Bonita. Fort Point, a fortress built on solid rock, commands the entrance from the south, and beyond it, until San Francisco is reached, are a series of sand dunes, some of them white and drifting and others showing green with the scant grass growing upon them. The entrance to the bay is called the Golden Gate, a name applied with singular appropriateness, since through its portals have passed continuous streams of gold since the discovery of the latter in 1848. Strangely enough, the name was given before the gold discovery, though at how early a date there seems no means of knowing....San Francisco Bay is about forty miles in length, its widest point being twelve miles. At Oakland, directly east of San Francisco, it is eight miles in width. Alcatraz Island, in the centre of the channel, six miles from the Golden Gate, is a solid rock rising threateningly above the water, and bristling with heavy artillery. It is sixteen hundred feet in length, and four hundred and fifty feet in width. Angel Island is directly north of Alcatraz, and four miles from San Francisco, contains eight hundred acres, and is also fortified. Midway between San Francisco and Oakland is Yerba Buena, or Goat Island, which, too, is hel as a United States military station. Red Rock, Bird Rock, the Two Sisters, and other small islands dot the bay.","Willard W.

Savannah,"Savannah, Georgia",32.0718,-81.0929,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"The Savannah River winds around Hutchinson Island, and the city is built in the form of an elongated crescent, about three miles in length, on its southern shore. It is on a bluff about forty feet above the stream, this bluff being about a mile wide at its eastern end, and broadening as it extends westward. Surrounding it are the low lands occupied by market gardens, for Savannah is a great place for market gardeners, and helps to supply the northern market in early spring. The streets of Savannah are laid out east and west, nearly parallel to the river, with others crossing them at right angles, north and south. They are wide, and everywhere shaded with trees, many of the latter being live oaks, most magnificent specimens of which are found in the city. Orange trees also abound, with their fragrant blossoms and golden fruit, stately palmettoes, magnolias and oleander, rich in bloom, bays and cape myrtles. The streets running north and south are of very nearly uniform width, every alternate street passing on either side of a public square, which is bounded on the north and south by narrow streets running east and west, and intersected in the centre by a wide street taking the same direction. These public squares, twenty-four in number, and containing from one and a half to three acres, are a marked feature of the city. They are placed at regular intervals, as already described, are handsomely inclosed, laid out with walks, shaded with evergreen and ornamental trees, and in the spring and summer months are green with grass. In a number of these are monuments, while others contain fountains or statuary. These squares or plazas are surrounded with fine residences, each having its own little yard, beautiful with flowers, vines, shrubbery and trees. In these premises roses thrive and bloom with a luxuriance unknown in the North, and the stately Camelia Japonica, the empress among flowers, grows here to a height of twelve or fifteen feet, and blossoms in midwinter. Savannah, the most beautiful city of the South, if not in the United States, is more like the wealthy suburb of some large city, than like a city itself. It i embowered in trees, which are green the whole year around; and shares with Cleveland, its northern rival in beauty, the soubriquet of the “Forest City"".","Willard W.

Springfield,"Springfield, Massachusetts",42.1015,-72.5871,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"A visit to the City Library, on State street, cannot fail to interest every person who feels a pride in the public institutions of New England. A fine, large, brick and stone building, with plain exterior and artistically finished interior, is the Springfield Public Library. Over forty thousand volumes cover its shelves, and are so systematically arranged that the librarian or his assistants can produce at once any work named in the catalogue. The oblong reading room is furnished with black walnut tables; and winding staircases, painted in blue and gold, lead from the columned alcoves to the galleries above. The library owns some very old and valuable books of engravings. A room on the first floor is devoted to stuffed birds, geological specimens, preserved snakes, and a wonderful assortment of curious relies obtained from all parts of the world. Icelandic snow shoes and Hindoo gods occupy places on the same shelf, in peaceful proximity, and catamounts, paralyzed in the act of springing, glare at you harmlessly behind their glass cases. Patriotic mementoes are not wanting, as the bullet-riddled battle-flags of Massachusetts regiments will testify. The free public library system is distinctively a New England institution, and wields a mighty influence for good.","Willard W.

Saint Louis,"Saint Louis, Missouri",38.6269,-90.2181,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"St. Louis is situated in the very heart of the great Mississippi Valley, and a large share of its rich agricultural products and mineral stores are constantly poured into her lap. Pilot Knob and Iron Mountain, both containing inexhaustible supplies of the useful ore, are not far distant. The lead districts of Missouri include more than 6,000 square miles. In fifteen counties there is copper. In short, within one hundred miles of St. Louis, gold, iron, lead, zinc, copper, tin, silver, platina, nickel, emery, cobalt, coal, limestone, granite, pipe-clay, fire-clay, marble, metallic paints and salt are found, in quantities which will repay working. In the State there are twenty millions acres of good farming lands; five millions of acres are among the best in the world for grapes; and eight millions are particularly suited to the raising of hemp. There is, besides, a sufficiency of timber land. With all these resources from which to draw, it would be surprising if St. Louis did not become a leading city in the West. Situated, as she is, on the Mississippi River, about midway between its source and its mouth, the junction of the Missouri twenty miles above, and that of the Ohio about one hundred and seventy-five miles below, and being the river terminus of a complicated system of western railways, the towns and cities, and even the small hamlets of the north, south and west, and to a limited extent of the east also, all pay her tribute. As Chicago is the gateway to the East, by means of the great chain of lakes and rivers at whose head she sits, so St. Louis holds open the door to the South and the East as well, through the Mississippi and the Ohio rivers.","Willard W.

Syracuse,"Syracuse, New York",43.0562,-76.1653,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"Syracuse is sometimes known as the Central City, on account of its location near the geographical centre of New York. It was first settled in 1787, and did not pass the limits of a small village until the completion of the Erie canal, in 1825. Two canals and three or four lines of railway now centre here, and contribute to the growth of this enterprising city. The region surrounding Syracuse is rife with the romantic history of that once powerful Indian Confederacy known as the Six Nations, now fast fading from the memory of men. The site of their ancient Council House was on Onondaga Creek, a few miles distant from the city, and is still held sacred to their traditions by the remnant of the lost tribes now occupying the Indian reservation. The principal street for retail business in Syracuse is named Salina, and it always wears an air of brisk trade and enterprise. The large dry goods houses of McCarthy and of Milton Price are located on this street. Some of the public edifices are built of Onondaga limestone, quarried a few miles out of the city. It makes very handsome building material, as the Court House and other structures will testify. The ranking hotels of Syracuse are the Vanderbilt and Globe, though the Remington, Syracuse and Empire Hotels are well-kept and well-conducted houses. The Erie Canal runs through the heart of the city, and the bridges over it are arranged with draws. The first steam canal boat I ever saw lay moored at this place, at the corner of Water and Clinton streets. It was gay with new paint and floating pennons, and created quite a sensation on its first trip out. It belonged to Greenway, the great ale man, and was named after his daughter.","Willard W.

Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",43.6493,-79.4125,Willard W. Glazier,1886,"Toronto, the capital of the Province of Ontario, is situated on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, on a beautiful and nearly circular bay, about five miles in length, formed by a long, narrow, curved tongue of land, extending out into the lake in a southwest direction. This harbor is capable of receiving the largest vessels upon the lake, and is defended at its entrance by a fort upon the extreme end of the peninsula, which is called Gibraltar Point. This fort was thoroughly repaired in 1864, and mounted with the most efficient modern ordnance. The growth of Toronto has been more rapid than that of any other city in Canada. Though of such recent origin compared with many Canadian towns, it is now second only to Montreal in size and population, the former having increased from twelve hundred in 1837 to upwards of eighty thousand at the present time. The site of the city is low, the surrounding country being level, but free from swamp and perfectly dry. The ground rises gently from the shores of the lake. The scenery in the vicinity is tame and comparatively monotonous, though not unpleasing. The city lies along the shores of the lake for something over two miles, and extends inward about a mile and a half. As one approaches Toronto its outlines appear picturesque, being varied and broken by an unusual number of handsome spires. The traveler will be pleasantly surprised, as he enters the city, at the extent and excelence of its public edifices, the number of its churches, and its general handsome and well-to-do aspect. Many of the houses and business structures are built of light-colored brick, having a soft and cheerful appearance. The streets are laid out regularly, crossing each other at right angles, and, as a general thing, are well paved. In the winter time they are filled with sleighs, and the air is alive with the music of sleigh-bells...Five railways centre at Toronto, connecting it with every section of Canada, the West and the South. The principal of these are the Grand Trunk and Great Western railways, which connect the city by through lines with the East and West. While navigation is open magnificent steamers connect it with all points on the lake, and carry on an extensive commerce. It imports large quantities of lumber, both manufactured and unmanufactured; wheat and other grain, soap, salt and glue; while foundries, distilleries, breweries, tanneries, rope-walks, paper and flour mills, furnish products which reach markets throughout the Provinces and States.","Willard W.

New York City,"New York City, New York",40.7507,-73.9853,James Boardman,1833,"The gay emporium of the west, the city of New York, which already contains above two hundred thousand inhabitants, is situated at the south end of an island of about fourteen miles in length, by one and a half in breadth. It is bounded on the west by the Hudson or north river, which is here above a mile in width, and on the east by the river of that name, which separates it from the populous town of Brooklyn, on Long Island. The point opposite the bay at the junction of the rivers, and called the Battery, from its being the site of the old Dutch fortifications, is laid out with taste as a park. or mall; the verdant foliage of which affords a most agreeable shelter from the scorching rays of the sun, and renders it a delightful and favourite promenade. The main street, called Broadway, is two miles and a half long, in a straight line, and proportionably wide, with broad flagged trottoirs or side-walks, some parts of which are shaded by poplars and other lofty trees; but in the quarter devoted to business, canvass blinds are stretched from the shops to permanent wooden rails of a convenient height and neatly finished. The architecture of the buildings, however, does not at all correspond with the magnificent scale of the street, the greatest irregularity prevailing; handsome edifices of brick, and even marble, of four and five stories, being side by side with those of two or three, and in some parts actually intermixed with miserable wooden cottages. Four of the largest episcopal churches, as well as the principal hotels and boarding houses, are situated in this great thoroughfare; and it is also the Regent Street for shops, or stores, as all depositaries of merchandise, whether large or small, are called. They are mostly of mean exterior, although furnished with every variety of goods from all parts of the world.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 21-2.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Albany,"Albany, New York",42.6517,-73.7544,James Boardman,1833,"Albany is one of the oldest settlements in the country, having been founded by the Dutch above two centuries; and we noticed several houses yet standing, built of bricks brought from Holland, and bearing the dates of their erection in rude ornamental iron-work on their lofty pediments. From a comparatively insignificant place, it has become a populous city, its trade having rapidly increased since the introduction of steam navigation, and the opening of the great western and northern canals, for both which it is the entrepôt. The capitol, or state house, is a handsome building, and is finely situated, being on an eminence, and at the extremity of a long and wide street. The interior is conveniently arranged for the meetings of the legislature, as well as for the superior courts of justice. It likewise contains the state library. The public seminary is a spacious edifice, and accommodates 200 students.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 119.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Rochester,"Rochester, New York",43.1601,-77.6056,James Boardman,1833,"Rochester, which we reached at noon on the third day, is in some respects the most wonderful place on the face of the globe. It was only founded twenty years ago, previous to which the country was a perfect wilderness. In 1815, the population but consisted of about three hundred persons; whilst in the year 1829, at the period of our visit, it had risen to thirteen thousand, and was rapidly progressing. The local advantages of Rochester are very conspicuous. Seated upon the fine river Genesee, which flows through a fertile country, and is navigable for barges nearly one hundred miles above, and for sloops from Lake Ontario, seven miles below, to within two of the town, intersected by the great western canal; possessing in abundance what the Americans denominate “hydraulic privileges,” but what in plain English would be termed inexhaustible water power: it is destined to become a place of great importance. The flour, or, as they are called, flouring, mills, are numerous, and several of them are erected upon a most extensive scale; one of these immense structures containing more than four acres of flooring. They were all in full operation, and are a source of much wealth to the place. I was informed that more than twelve thousand bushels of wheat were daily ground in these mills. The produce is chiefly sent to New York; but should the Montreal or Quebec markets offer inducements, the facilities of transport to those places are now very great, the water communication being perfected by the completion of the Rideau canal in Canada. The streets and public buildings are upon a handsome scale; and besides a number of large churches, banks, hotels, and other erections of an ornamental nature, Rochester has its athenæum, museum, and other scientific institutions. The most singular feature of this bustling infant town is the condition of the environs, which are still very much in a state of nature. The transition from a crowded street to the ruins of the forest, or to the forest itself, is so sudden, that a stranger, by turning a wrong corner in the dark, might either be in danger of breaking his neck over the enormous stumps of trees, which, as yet, there has been no time to Clear away; or, escaping that calamity, might soon be entangled in the labyrinth of wood which environs this unparalleled place.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 129-31.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Buffalo,"Buffalo, New York",42.8853,-78.876,James Boardman,1833,"Buffalo, like Manchester and Lewiston, fell a prey to the flames during the last war; having been set on fire by the British, in retaliation for a similar outrage committed by the Americans at Newark, on the Canadian frontier. It has since been rebuilt, and is rapidly extending. Its situation, as the point of junction between the great western canal and Lake Erie, gives it immense advantages; and the day is not far distant, when Buffalo will become one of the most important places in the state. A commodious harbour has lately been constructed; and besides a number of schooners and trading sloops, steamers of large burden sail regularly during the season between this place and the various ports on the coasts of Lake Erie; among others to that of Cleaveland, the entrance of the Ohio canal lately finished, which, after passing for the distance of three hundred miles through the fertile and now populous state of that name, communicates with the great river Ohio, one of the grand tributaries to the Mississippi. These vessels also visit Detroit, a populous district, and occasionally make trips to the new settlements, as far as Lake Michigan, a distance of nearly one thousand miles. The neighbourhood of Detroit, which was founded by the French, nearly two centuries ago, was represented to me as being a most desirable location. The squares and streets of Buffalo are planned upon an extensive scale, and the buildings are pretty good. The Eagle Hotel, that at which we took up our quarters, is not only very large, but is equal in most respects to the best in Great Britain.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 154-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The streets, excepting the two centre ones in each direction, are rather narrow, but perfectly straight, and cross each other at right angles at equal distances. Those from river to river are about two miles in length, and are named after different descriptions of trees, as Chestnut, Walnut, Spruce, Pine; while those in the contrary direction, the length of which is gradually prolonged with the increase of buildings, are numbered. The houses are of brick, and regular in their architecture. The steps, and the parts about the doors and windows, which, in England, are usually of stone, are of white marble; which, with the white painted doors, silvered plates and knobs, have a very chaste effect. The side walks are paved with brick, and are kept remarkably clean; and the shops are superior, as regards their external appearance, to those of New York; more of them also are devoted to the sale of engravings, and other branches of the fine arts, than in that city. Among the number of public edifices which adorn Philadelphia, the most interesting, although not the most beautiful, is the State House; for in one of its halls was signed the document which separated thirteen of the American colonies from Great Britain.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 186-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The plan of the embryo capital is at once grand and unique. Very long and broad avenues diverge from centres, and are intersected by streets at right angles. Only one of the former, however, and not many of the latter, contain any buildings; and these are, for the most part, as paltry as they are scattered, although the city contains a population of twenty thousand persons. The chief architectural ornament of Washington, and, indeed, of the Union, is the edifice called the Capitol, in which are the Chambers of Congress, the Supreme Courts, and the National Library. This noble building, which stands on a most commanding site, is 350 feet in length, and is surmounted by a lofty but heavy dome. The style of architecture is Palladian, and the material freestone; but, in consequence of the discolouration produced by the burning of the interior by the British, the whole of the outside has been painted white, —a very questionable proceeding as regards effect, to say nothing of the periodical expense which will be thereby incurred. The principal entrance, which is under a magnificent portico, opens into a circular hall or rotunda, one hundred feet in diameter, and exactly the same in height. The walls of this classical apartment are ornamented with large paintings by the venerable Colonel Trumbull, to whom I have before made allusion.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 224-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

Eighty years ago it contained not more than twenty or thirty mean tenements, and its shipping was limited to one small square-rigged vessel. The same place now numbers upwards of seventy thousand inhabitants, and its ships trade to every quarter of the habitable globe. Unlike New York or Philadelphia, the surface of the ground upon which the city stands is irregular. The streets are mostly at right angles, and of a good width; but they are not kept in neat order, and swine innumerable roam at large. The houses are built of excellent red bricks, quantities of which are exported to New York and other places.
  The city contains several handsome public edifices; the principal of which, in point of extent, is the Exchange. This spacious building contains a noble hall for the accommodation of the merchants and others, who meet shaded from the burning suns of summer, or the cold blasts of winter. A gentleman, to whom I expressed my admiration of the beauty of this hall, remarked, as a singular circumstance, and as one that struck him on his travels, that the ports of Great Britain, the greatest commercial nation in the world, with its humid climate too, should not possess any mercantile places of rendezvous of this description open to the public.","James Boardman, America and the Americans (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman, 1833), 257-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",42.3575,-71.0638,James Boardman,1833,"Boston, which has been founded two centuries, was originally called Tremont, or Tremountain, from the circumstance of its being situated on three hills. The city is almost surrounded by water; the connection with the main land being formed by a narrow strip called the Neck. The communication, in other directions, is kept up by timber bridges; one of which is no less than 1300 yards in length. The older streets are irregular — indeed, as tortuous as those of the old towns of England; but such as are of later date are laid out at right angles. They are kept in neat order; and, unlike the thoroughfares of all the other cities we had visited, they were not perambulated day and night by swine. Many of the original names have given place to others more congenial to the state of political feeling; thus, Washington has superseded Marlborough, and King and Queen have been metamorphosed into Court and State Street...It is not in the interior of the State House alone that the eye and mind are gratified. The view from the lofty dome, by which it is surmounted, is as extensive as it is picturesque; and full of historical interest, as regards the commencement of the glorious struggle, which terminated, happily for mankind, in American independence. At our feet lay the city, with its halls, and its sites, rendered memorable as the places where the intelligence and free spirits of the country discussed their wrongs, or gave vent to their outraged feelings in bold and energetic, yet peaceable remonstrances. Taking a wider range, in one direction the eye rested upon the blood-stained field, where a despotic government was taught, by a severe lesson, to respect the sacred rights of man; while, in another, it gazed upon those eminences, where the military genius of a Washington displayed itself, as if by magic, to the discomfiture of the retiring foe. The wide expanse of the unruffled bay, with its archipelago of islands, the undulated country, sprinkled with smiling villages, and cheerful habitations, together with the bold outline of the distant hills, all combined under an atmosphere as pure as it was mild, produced an enchanting picture, and one which is indelibly impressed on the memory. In front of the State House is a park, many acres in extent, which, in the colonial times, bore the name of the Common; but having been railed, and ornamented, is now dignified with the title of Mall. Here the British troops were for some time encamped; and near a huge and ancient elm, which still spreads its venerable arms, are the remains of a redoubt, thrown up at that period.

There are several large stores in this town, which appears to be rapidly increasing. Our course now lay along the Illinois, the scenery of which is extremely beautiful, indeed superior to any of the kind which I had seen. The rocks rise abruptly from the valley of the river, at the distance of quarter of a mile on either side; some protruded here and there from the bed of the stream; the slopes were covered with wood, the foliage of which exhibited the most glowing tints of red and yellow; and the shrubs and herbage of the lower ground presented forms as beautiful as they were new to me. I have little doubt, that when the scenery of Ottawa is properly known and appreciated, it will be visited by crowds. About a mile below it, a town has been planned, which is to be named Gibraltar, on account of the abrupt rocks which rise in its vicinity. The grass on the flat land attains a height of six, or even sometimes nine feet, and in the waggon we were in a manner completely overtopped by it over a space of nearly three miles.","James Logan, Notes of a Journey through Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies (Edinburgh: Fraser and Co., 1838), 108-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Havannah,"Havana, Cuba",23.1384,-82.3723,James Logan,1838,"This celebrated place is remarkable for its natural beauties. On an eminence nearly an hundred feet high, with an almost perpendicular front, is a castle, strongly fortified, and facing the harbour, which has so narrow an entrance as to permit only one vessel to enter at a time, and is completely protected by the guns of the fort, which extend nearly a quarter of a mile along its side. Opposite to this fort is another, nearly on a level with the water, and from which, on the south side, the town stretches along the harbour, which is nearly a mile in length, and gradually enlarges, so as to form at its upper part a large basin, in which an hundred vessels may ride at anchor in perfect security, the water being deep, and complete shelter being afforded by the rising ground all round. The town stretches away from the harbour to some distance; its streets are narrow, parallel, and intersecting; and almost all the houses are of two stories, and castellated, so as greatly to add to the effect of the scenery.","James Logan, Notes of a Journey through Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies (Edinburgh: Fraser and Co., 1838), 198-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,Cuba,Caribbean,North America
Kingston,"Kingston, Jamaica",18.0042,-76.8068,James Logan,1838,"The distance from the entrance to Kingston is six miles, the harbour gradually expanding into a basin, which is in some parts shallow, but in the centre of sufficient depth for vessels drawing ten or twelve feet. Several ships of war were at anchor off Port-Royal...There is only one respectable tavern, and there the accommodations are inferior, and the charges most immoderate, from three to four dollars being taken for dinner alone. The lodgings, however, are very good, although the charges are very high, four dollars a week being taken, five shillings for breakfast, and six shillings and eightpence for dinner. The houses in the principal streets are detached, generally of two stories, and built of wood, with verandahs and flower-plots in front. The streets are wide, but very sandy, and not well kept.... The ground between the road and the harbour is marshy, and must in dry weather render Kingston very unhealthy, though for several years past there has been little fever there. A few villas, almost all wooden, were seen on the other side.","James Logan, Notes of a Journey through Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies (Edinburgh: Fraser and Co., 1838), 222-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,Jamaica,Caribbean,North America
Montgomery,"Montgomery, Alabama",32.3719,-86.3074,James Logan,1838,"Montgomery, the first town through which we passed, is built on a rising ground, on the north bank of Alabama River, which is about a mile distant from the principal street. From an eminence above the town there is a good viewer of it, and of the adjacent country, which is bounded by hills. The houses are generally good, and there are several taverns, of which the largest and most commodious is the Montgomery Arms. For a bottle of Scotch ale I was here charged a dollar, the landlord having told me before drawing the cork that I could not have it for less. The river is navigable for steamers drawing three feet of water, as far up as Wetumptka, which is 400 miles distant from Mobile.","James Logan, Notes of a Journey through Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies (Edinburgh: Fraser and Co., 1838), 175-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

This town, which is the principal sea-port of the State, is said to contain nearly 20,000 inhabitants. Its streets are regular and good, and the houses of the principal merchants are built with much taste. There are several handsome churches, and a fine new academy.","James Logan, Notes of a Journey through Canada, the United States of America, and the West Indies (Edinburgh: Fraser and Co., 1838), 176.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Auckland,"Auckland, New Zealand",-36.8471,174.771,Alfred Falk,1877,"Skirting the coast, at a distance too great to permit of our noting its general appearance, we passed Cape Brett, situated at the entrance to the Bay of Islands, and steaming down the Hauraki Gulf, between the Great and Little Barrier Islands, soon entered Auckland harbour, where a remarkably pretty landscape was spread out before us. On one side lay the city, its outskirts extending on either side into the hills; while the wide expanse of the harbour, with its numerous inlets and islands, lay stretched out in front of it, seemingly landlocked, and resembling a large lake, surrounded by a background of green hills. Auckland is picturesquely situated in the North Island of New Zealand, at a point where its breadth is only six miles; and possesses two fine harbours. Waitemata, the principal of these, and along the shores of which the city is built, is very fine, and one of the safest in New Zealand. It is an inlet of the Firth of Thames, and consists of an inner harbour, almost landlocked by Rangitoto and Tapu Islands, containing good wharfage accommodation; and an outer bay of considerable extent, called Hauraki Gulf, protected by the Great and Little Barrier Islands. On the western side of North Island, and distant only six miles from Auckland, with which it is connected by a tramway, is Manukau harbour, on which is situated the small town of Onehunga, and from which most of the intercolonial trade is carried on. Auckland is regularly laid out, the streets being straight and wide, and crossing one another at right angles. Queen Street, the principal thoroughfare, extends a distance of a couple of miles from the wharves, and contains the principal buildings. The public buildings are generally good, built for the most part of brick, faced with stone; the most important being the Government Offices, the Post Office and Custom House, and the Supreme Court. Government House is a handsome edifice, erected on an eminence which commands a grand view of the harbour, and situated in the midst of ornamental grounds, containing many fine trees. Auckland contains something under 25,000 inhabitants. It is the second city in New Zealand, in point of population and commercial importance, and was, until 1865, the political capital of the colony; when it was found advisable to select a town with a more central position for the seat of Government, and the Legislature was removed to Wellington. Auckland has lost, in consequence, some of its former importance; but, from its unrivalled position, seems destined to become a great city, especially when the large tract of country occupied by the Maoris is brought under cultivation, and the railway system extended throughout the Island. It is at present a busy thriving place, and is rendered more characteristic of the country than other New Zealand towns by the number of the Aborigines or Maoris seen in its streets.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 2-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,New Zealand,Oceania,Oceania
Honolulu,"Honolulu, Hawaii",21.3081,-157.8614,Alfred Falk,1877,"Honolulu, the metropolis and chief port of the group, is a pretty little town, containing about 10,000 inhabitants. Its appearance, viewed from the harbour, is remarkably picturesque, being embowered in luxuriant vegetation, with a background of volcanic hills of most irregular shapes, their sides covered with verdure, and their craggy peaks rising to a great height. In rear of the town is a peculiarly-shaped eminence called Punchbowl Hill, the summit of which is crowned by a small battery, to protect the harbour. The harbour consists of a roadstead and an inner basin; the former protected by a spit of land extending into the sea, called Diamond Head, and the latter accommodating at its wharves ships of very large tonnage—our steamer, a vessel of 3,200 tons register, being very comfortably berthed. The entrance to the harbour, as in most of the islands in the Pacific, is through a passage in the coral reef that extends round the island of Oahu. These passages through the reefs are supposed to be formed by currents of cold fresh water coming from the land, in which the coral insects that build up these reefs upon submerged portions of the islands cannot exist. Honolulu consists of regularly laid out streets, that have, however, more the appearance of wide, rural lanes, from the luxuriance of the vegetation in the gardens, and the number of beautiful trees standing between the houses. It contains some good public buildings, amongst which it is pleasing to see a public library, with 1,500 books of reference, and numerous churches. The king's palace is a plain unpretentious building of coral-stone, situated on about an acre of well laid out ground, surrounded by a high wall, at the entrance gate in which stands a native sentry, in his neat uniform of blue coat and white trousers.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 2-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Oceania; Pacific,North America
San Francisco,"San Francisco, California",37.7837,-122.433,Alfred Falk,1877,"San Francisco , the chief city of the State of California, and the New York of the Pacific Coast, is situated at the end of a peninsula thirty miles long and six miles across, which separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. It lies at the foot of high hills, which, in the early days of the city, were cut up by numerous gullies, and the low land at their base was of small extent. Many of these hills have been levelled, the gullies filled up, and the narrow portion of the peninsula widened with land reclaimed from the ocean; thus there are now paved streets and busy thoroughfares, where once large ships rode at anchor. The city is regularly laid out, the streets being straight, broad, and crossing one another at right angles; the business portion is compactly built, and may be said to cover an area of nine square miles, lying between Telegraph, Rincon, and Russian Hills. It is substantially built, for the greater part, of stone; but the outskirts are straggling, the houses being wide apart, and generally of wood. The rapid growth of San Francisco is almost unprecedented, equalled only by that of Melbourne, Victoria, which owes its rise to the same cause, viz., the gold discoveries. The first house built on the present site of the city was in 1835, when the settlement was called Terba Buena, from a medicinal herb found in the vicinity; this was changed to its present name, San Francisco, in 1847. In 1848, when gold was first discovered, the population amounted to 1,000; the great immigration from the East then set in, and in 1850 the population had increased to 25,000; in 1860, to 57,000; in 1870, to 150,000; and is now estimated at over 175,000 inhabitants....The principal thoroughfare is Montgomery-street, which, with its fine blocks of buildings, is a very handsome street. It extends at its northern extremity to the top of a hill, too precipitous for carriages to ascend; but pedestrians can do so by means of a flight of steps, and from the top a fine view of the city and bay is obtained. Market and Kearneystreets are also fine thoroughfares, and contain many of the best retail establishments. In California-street are the principal banks and brokers' offices; whilst Front, Sansome, and Battery-streets form the centre of the wholesale trade of the city. The best private residences are situated in Van Ness Avenue, Pine-street Hill, Bush and Geary-streets. The traffic in some of these streets is very great, and forcibly reminds one of parts of the city of London.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 22-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Pacific; Northern America,North America
Sacramento,"Sacramento, California",38.5749,-121.4964,Alfred Falk,1877,"Sacramento, the political capital of the “Golden State,” is a pretty place, containing about 50,000 inhabitants. It is situated at the head of navigation on the Sacramento River, near its confluence with the great American river; and is distant about 125 miles from the Pacific. It very much resembles a large colonial up-country town, and is the seat of some rather extensive manufactures. It is a thriving and busy place, and, during the sessions of the State Legislature, swarms with numbers of political agents and hangers-on. The Capitol, or State House, is a noble building, in the Corinthian style of architecture, surmounted by a grand cupola, which renders it a very conspicuous object, from every point of the surrounding plains. It is, unquestionably, one of the finest edifices in the United States. Sacramento is the centre of a large railway system, and from it, lines radiate to all parts of the State; hence it seems likely in time, to become a large and important city. The streets are broad and well paved, and lined with trees, which form an agreeable shade in summer. The houses are generally built of brick, and have a substantial and pleasing look; whilst the recent erections are really handsome in appearance.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 34-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Pacific; Northern America,North America
Salt Lake City,"Salt Lake City, Utah",40.7521,-111.8975,Alfred Falk,1877,"The city is built at the foot of the Wahsatch Mountains, which were covered with snow from the summits to the base, and looked very imposing, seeming, as they did, to lift their whitecapped tops right into the clouds. A storm in these mountains, witnessed from the city, is a grand sight. Two peaks or summits, called the Twin Peaks, distant about 15 miles southeasterly, are 11,000 feet high, and have never been free from snow since the settlement in this valley. Salt Lake, that veritable Dead Sea, is 120 miles long, by about 45 miles broad, and contains seven islands. Its waters are so salt that nothing can live in them, and the fish that find their way down the rivers Jordan, and Weber, are soon killed. It is said, that enough salt to supply the whole world, could be obtained by evaporation. I took a sail on
  the lake, but found its banks destitute of vegetation, and its dreary, barren, appearance uninviting. The rivers Jordan and Weber empty themselves into the lake, but there is no outlet; and the waters are said to have risen some 10 feet since 1850. A peculiar feature of Salt Lake is two rocks: one, a great mass, rising abruptly out of the water, and standing black and desolate, called Black Rock; the other, overhanging the margin, and bearing an indistinct resemblance to a human face, is called Profile Rock. Salt Lake City is situated at the foot of the Wahsatch Mountains, on a plain that has, by indomitable perseverance and toil, been converted from a wilderness, impregnated with alkali, and productive only of sagebush, into a smiling agricultural country, dotted over with the farms, or, as they are here called, the “ranches” of the settlers. A slight description of this most remarkable city may not be out of place, before I proceed to give an account of the people who inhabit it, and of the territory in which it is situated. Salt Lake City is regularly laid out in the form of the letter L; the larger portion stretching east and west, and the shorter north and south. The streets—as is usual in all new American towns—are wide, cross one another at right angles, and follow the cardinal points of the compass; but they possess an unique appearance, as they have brooks of clear water flowing down either side, and watering the roots of trees, planted so, as to cast a pleasant shade over the pathway. These shade-trees, bordering every thoroughfare, and the numerous orchards in, and around the city, give it the appearance of being embowered in foliage—very refreshing to the eye in the hot season. The city is laid out in square blocks of ten acres each, covers a space of about nine square miles, and contains a population of some 25,000 inhabitants; 20,000 of whom are Mormons, and the remainder Gentiles—as all are called who do not profess the faith of Mormon.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 43-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Plains; Northern America,North America
Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.879,-87.6483,Alfred Falk,1877,"Chicago is, in population, the third city of the Union; in commercial importance, it Tanks after New York; its population may be set down at 400,000. In 1830, it was only a trading station with the Indians, consisting at thattime of a few log houses only; and the city has attained its present proportions, since that comparatively recent date. What causes it, however, to be regarded as the most remarkable city in the world, is the fact, that since the great fire of 1871, the greatest conflagration of modern times—in which three and a half square miles of the principal part of the city were burned; in which 17,450 buildings were destroyed, and 98,000 people rendered homeless; the monetary loss of which, was estimated at little short of thirtyseven millions sterling, ten millions only of which, were coveredMby insurance—the city has sprung up like a phoenix out of its ashes, and now shows but few traces of the dire calamity. The buildings destroyed, have all been replaced by noble stone edifices; so that now Chicago may justly claim to be a “City of Palaces.” In 1874, another fire broke out in the devoted city, and six hundred acres of buildings were consumed; yet, in spite of these disastrous drawbacks, Chicago exhibits but few remains of either devastation. The position of the city is most favourable, being situated mid-way between the Eastern and Western States; on Lake Michigan, which gives it a splendid water-way. It is also the centre of a vast railway system, and has in consequence become the greatest grain emporium in the world, and also the largest cattle and lumber market. It has not been without straining every nerve, that the city has been rebuilt in such an incalculably short time; house rents are very high in consequence, and ratepayers obtain some concession, by paying their rates in advance. Chicago is well laid out, the streets being generally eighty feet wide; some of them are from three to seven miles in length, run due north to south, and east to west, and cross one another at right angles. The Chicago River runs through the city, and with its two branches, divides it into three parts; between which, communication is effected by means of thirty-three bridges. These bridges swing on central pivots, and have to be opened to allow vessels to pass; but as this is found to interrupt the street traffic, they are commencing to build tunnels, under the bed of the river. Two have already been completed; one connects the northern and western divisions of the city, and is 1,600 feet long; the other joins the northern and southern, and is 1,900 feet in length.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 69-71.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Great Lakes; Northern America,North America
Detroit,"Detroit, Michigan",42.3439,-83.0583,Alfred Falk,1877,"Detroit is a clean and pretty town, containing many fine villa residences; it is situated on the Detroit River—a noble stream, twenty miles long, connecting Erie Lake with Lake St. Clair; and forming here, the best harbour on the whole chain of lakes. Detroit is the principal city of Michigan, and contains some 100,000 inhabitants; the river front for miles is lined with warehouses, dry-docks, shipbuilding yards, founderies, and grain-elevators; and the city is laid out on the usual American rectangular plan. The streets are broad; those containing the business premises vary from 50 to 100 feet in width; the avenues of private mansions from 100 to 200 feet. They are generally planted, with a double row of trees on both sides, and these beech, chestnut, oak, elm, and maple trees, all covered with foliage, give a pretty countrified appearance to the city, and form a most agreeable shade. The Campus Martius, a fine open space or square, is the principal feature in the arrangement of the city. Taking up the whole side of this square stands the City Hall, a noble stone building in the Italian style; consisting of three stories, above the basement, and surmounted by a Mansard roof. In the middle of the square is the Soldier's Monument; erected in memory of the Michigan soldiers who fell in the civil war. On the north side of the Campus Martius is the Opera House, one of the largest buildings of the kind, in the country. This square is crossed by Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and from it radiate Munroe Avenue and Fort-street. These avenues, for miles, are lined on both sides with detached, and semi-detached houses, each standing in its own garden. In the centre of the city is a semicircular park, called the Grand Circus, which is divided in two by Woodward Avenue, each part containing a fine fountain. The principal buildings are the Custom House, and Post Office, both under the same roof, and the Board of Trade. The Great Wheat Elevator of the Michigan Central Railway Company is a large building, from the cupola of which a grand view is obtained of the city, river, and Lakes St. Clair and Erie. The manufactures of the city are rather extensive, comprising ironworks, machine-shops for the construction of railway rolling-stock; flour mills, breweries, and extensive tobacco and cigar factories; the shipping interests are also large. Pork and fish-packing are carried on very extensively.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 76-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Great Lakes; Northern America,North America
Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",43.6599,-79.3884,Alfred Falk,1877,"Toronto is, after Montreal, the largest city of Canada; it has a population of 60,000; and is situated on a beautiful bay, the entrance to which is narrow, and protected by a long spit of land, called Gibraltar Point. The city has a very English appearance, and the streets, though not wide, are generally well paved. The principal are King and Yonge streets, which contain all the best retail establishments. Front street, containing large blocks of warehouses, is also a fine thoroughfare. The University of Toronto is a grand edifice, in the pure Norman style of architecture; the buildings forming three sides of a quadrangle. It is a noble institution, and one of which Canadians may justly be proud; it possesses a library of 20,000 volumes, and a fine museum of natural history. Adjoining the University is the Queen's Park, comprising fifty acres of well laid out ground; approached by long avenues of chestnut, beech, elm, and oak trees. In the park is a fine monument, surmounted by a large figure of Britannia; erected to the memory of those Canadians, who fell in repelling the Fenian invasion of 1866. The Post Office, built in the Ionic style, is a fine building; the City Hall is plain and unpretentious; the Custom House and Court House are handsome structures. Osgoode Hall is a very imposing, and extensive building of the Ionic Order; it contains the Provincial Courts, and has a fine law library. Amongst other buildings of a public character may be enumerated St. Lawrence Hall, the Masonic Hall, and the Exchange. Toronto is to Canada, what Edinburgh is to Scotland, the seat of its higher educational system; and contains many fine public schools, and colleges. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, is one of the principal, and most successful. Trinity College is a spacious building, with numerous turrets and quaint gables; and is situated in the midst of extensive grounds. The Normal School, for the training of teachers, the Model Schools, and the Educational Museum are plain buildings; but standing together, as they do, in a large park, they have a very picturesque appearance.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 86-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Montreal,"Montreal, Quebec",45.5046,-73.5679,Alfred Falk,1877,"Montreal, the commercial metropolis of Canada, is a nice clean city of 110,000 inhabitants, containing fine blocks of buildings; but especially notable, for the number, and beauty of its churches. It is situated on the Island of Montreal, which is thirty miles long, and ten broad, and is formed by the junction of the Ottawa, with the St. Lawrence. It is connected with the main land, by the splendid Victoria Bridge, called by Montrealers “the eighth wonder of the world.” This celebrated bridge is a mile and a half long, or with its approaches, nearly two miles; is supported upon twenty-four piers, and two abutments of solid masonry; the span between the centre piers being thirty-three feet. The iron tube, through which the lines are laid, is twenty-two feet high, and sixteen feet wide. This bridge ,was erected by Robert Stephenson, and though rather an eyesore, obstructing as it does, the view of the noble river; is the only means of traffic with the mainland, when the river being frozen over, navigation is impeded. The city is laid out very much like an old French town, but has of late been much improved; the streets are gradually being widened; and the city with its fine blocks of buildings, and its numerous public edifices, looks substantial, and shows the evidences of great accumulated wealth. The Quays are very fine; built entirely of solid limestone, and extending for several miles, undisfigured by unsightly warehouses, and stores, as is unfortunately so often the case. At a short distance from the city is the Mont Real, which gives to the city its name of Montreal, now used in place of the ancient Indian one Hochelaga. From the summit of this beautiful eminence, a magnificent panorama is presented of the city, with its noble quays, and glittering spires. From it can also be seen, the great St. Lawrence, as it winds its way, for miles, through a gently undulating plain, dotted with pretty little villages. This “mountain,” as it is locally called, is a general recreation ground for the people of Montreal; and round the base, and winding around the hill, are beautiful drives. St. James, and Notre Dame streets, are the principal promenades, and contain the best retail establishments. St. Paul street, fronting the quays, and extending their entire length, is the principal commercial thoroughfare; whilst other smaller streets, branching off these main arteries, contain large blocks of warehouses. The principal residences are in the suburbs, extending to the foot of the mountain.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 94-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Quebec,"Québec City, Quebec",45.4181,-75.6965,Alfred Falk,1877,"I left Montreal for Quebec, by the steamer City of Montreal, in the evening; and arrived at the latter city early the next morning. These river steamers are most commodious, and beautifully fitted up; and form, in the warm weather, a far more agreeable mode of travelling, than the dusty railway cars. The first appearance of Quebec from the river is very grand; here the banks rise precipitously, and are covered with fine trees, nestling amongst which are numerous private residences. The river widens considerably, and is commanded by the guns of the citadel, perched high up on the height; from which the ramparts extend round the city, rendering it so strong a fortress, that it has been called the “Gibraltar of America.” Since the regular troops who garrisoned it were recalled, and the charge of the fortress assumed by the Canadian Government; the ramparts are falling into decay, and the guns rusting. The British Government commenced the building of three powerful forts on Point Levi, opposite to Quebec, on the other side of the river; but left them in an incomplete state, and nothing has been done by the Canadian Government to finish them. It would consequently not be a difficult matter, for an enterprising enemy, to carry Quebec, as it stands, by a coup de main; and this fortress, formerly considered impregnable, in the hands of an enemy commanding the navigation of the St. Lawrence, would virtually place Canada at his feet...The streets of Quebec are very narrow, and steep; especially those connecting the Upper, with the Lower Town. A large portion of the Upper Town is taken up by the buildings of the great religious corporations of the dominant denomination; such as the Seminary, Laval University, the Ursulines, the Hôtel Dieu, and the ancient Jesuit College; which latter has more recently been used as a barracks. Over the remaining portion of Upper Town, not taken up by the fortifications, are crowded the quaint, mediæval streets, and houses; the latter built generally of stone, two storeys high, and roofed with a shining tin, which gives the city, when the sun shines on it, a very glittering appearance. The Lower Town is the oldest, and most important; here are clustered at the foot of the promontory, under the guns of the grand battery, 200 feet above, the principal wharves, ferry-landings, commercial houses, and banks.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 98-100.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Ottawa,"Ottawa, Ontario",45.4186,-75.6927,Alfred Falk,1877,"I now took the steamer up the River Ottawa, to visit the city of that name,—the political metropolis of the Dominion. This stream flows through thickly-wooded country, with extensive saw-mills on the banks, for the conversion of pine logs into planks, etc. Ottawa is situated on the river of that name, at its junction with the Rideau; the city being on a hill, between the two rivers, and divided into the Upper and Lower Town, by the Rideau Canal. It has a population of 25,000; is the centre of the lumber trade of the Ottawa and its tributaries; and otherwise possesses some extensive flour-mills, and manufactories of agricultural implements, mill machinery, &c. Facing it, on the opposite side of the river, are the suburbs of Hull, and New Edinburgh, connected with the city by several bridges. The great feature, however, of Ottawa, is that imposing pile, or rather piles of building,— forming as they do three sides of a quadrangle,—occupied as the Parliament Houses and Government Offices. These buildings are situated on a hill, descending abruptly to the river; are built in the Italian Gothic style; and, with their irregular towers, and pinnacles glittering in the sun, form as imposing a structure, as is to be seen in America. The south side of the quadrangle is formed by the Houses of Parliament; whilst the east and west sides, are taken up by the Departmental Offices. The two wings containing the latter, are quite detached from the front, forming the Parliament Houses; and there are thus three distinct blocks of building, which together form a pile, of which Canadians may justly be proud; and a fit abode, for the Legislature of the great colony. The interior of the Houses of Parliament is very fine; the Chambers for the two branches of the Legislature have beautiful stained glass windows, but are still very light. The Chamber of the Commons, to my mind, is far handsomer than its prototype at Westminster; but like it, its acoustic properties are bad. Facing the Speaker's chair is a fine statue of Her Majesty, and busts of the Prince and Princess of Wales; and the corridors contain portraits of former Speakers. The Parliament Library is a handsome structure, containing forty thousand volumes. The most important edifice in the city, after the Government buildings, is the Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame. This is a large stone building, with two spires covered with shining tin,—poor in style,—but having a very picturesque appearance, when seen from a distance. The scenery in the vicinity is very beautiful; consisting of well-timbered country, watered by several rivers, interspersed with numerous waterfalls. The principal of these are the Falls of the Chaudiére, and the Rideau; the former being especially beautiful.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 103-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Ticonderoga,"Ticonderoga, New York",43.8467,-73.423,Alfred Falk,1877,"A delightful trip through these various beautiful scenes brought us to Fort Ticonderoga, a ruin standing on a high rocky eminence. This fort was built by the French in 1756, and was named by them Carillon; but this has been supplanted by its present Indian appellation of Ticonderoga, which signifies “noisy,” so called from the Falls in the vicinity. Though now a ruin, it has been the scene of many a fierce struggle in former times. In 1758, it was attacked by an English force of 16,000 men, under Abercrombie, who was however repulsed, with a loss of 2,000 men; but in the following year, it was abandoned by the French, and taken possession of by the British. Ticonderoga has been held successively by the French, the British, the French again, the American Colonists, and was finally reduced by General Burgoyne; when it remained in the hands of the British, until the termination of the revolutionary war, and was then ceded to the Americans. The scenery in the vicinity of this old fortress is very beautiful, and the drive of four miles along the sparkling stream, that connects Lake Champlain with Lake George, is delightful. This turbulent little stream, has a descent of 230 feet; in the course of which, there are two series of lovely cascades, called the Falls of Ticonderoga. The romantic beauty of these, is however, marred by the factories that have been erected along the banks, near the villages of Alexandria and Ticonderoga. The scenery however, varies continually; and openings in the foliage, reveal vistas of the lake, with the hills and valleys of Vermont in the background; whilst the little stream foams, and tumbles, beside us, presenting at every turn, new and beautiful combinations, of rock draped with rich verdure, the colours of which harmonize beautifully with the dark blue of the lake, glimpses of which we are continually obtaining.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 118-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Saratoga,"Saratoga Springs, New York",43.0817,-73.7823,Alfred Falk,1877,"Saratoga contains a population of 9,000; but during the months of July and August, this number is increased by visitors to 30,000. The hotels are colossal; the principal being the Grand Union, the Congress Hall, and the United States, which are only open for four months out of the year, and will alone repay a visit to Saratoga. The Grand Union has over a mile in length of piazzas, two miles of halls, ten acres of carpets, and eight hundred bedrooms. These hotels are, in spite of their great size, very comfortable; and their proprietors cater for the amusement of their guests, during the season, by having good bands, and balls every night. They will each accommodate from a thousand to fifteen hundred guests. The arrivals at Saratoga, during the season, often amount to a thousand daily. And now a few words about the Springs, which are chalybeate or acidulous saline, according to the relative proportion of their particles; the constituent ones being carbonate of soda, chloride of sodium, carbonate of magnesia, hydriodate of soda, silica and alumina, carbonic acid gas, with occasional traces of iodine and potassa. The principal are Congress and Columbia Springs, both situated in a tastefully laid out little park, and over them elegant light structures have been erected; Excelsior Spring, situated in Excelsior Park; High Rock Spring, situated on the top of a rock, whence its name; the Hamilton and Hathorn Springs, in the centre of the town; the Washington, United States, and Empire Springs; Red Spring, so called from the colour of its waters when agitated; the Star, Eureka, and White Sulphur Springs. Putnam Spring is used for bathing purposes, being chalybeate. The most remarkable is the Geyser, or Spouting Spring, the waters of which spout up high in the air, through a shaft sunk 140 feet through the solid rock; and are very saline, and only fourteen degrees above zero. The Glacier Spring is another geyser, in close proximity to it. Life in Saratoga, in the great hotels, may be summed up in a few words. It is ephemeral, only lasting a couple of months; and during that period wealth, beauty, fashion, and other
  ingredients not so desirable, meet and intermingle, in the whirl and excitement of the
  ballroom at night; visits to the Springs in the morning; and promenades or drives, in the
  afternoon....","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 124-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Troy,"Troy, New York",42.7283,-73.6908,Alfred Falk,1877,"Taking train again, a pleasant journey through some of the fine midland counties of the Empire State,—as the State of New York is called, brought me to the important city of Troy. This remarkably pretty town contains many fine public edifices, churches, and private residences; and has a population of 45,000. It is the seat of some very extensive manufactures, the principal of which are large iron-works, and factories for the manufacture of carriages, boots and shoes, and hosiery. A notable feature, and a prominent landmark, is the Theological Seminary of St. Joseph, a fine structure of the Byzantine order of architecture, on Mount Ida. The city also contains the great Watervliet Arsenal, where are kept many relics of the battles that were fought around Saratoga and Yorkton. Six miles from Troy is the city of Albany, the capital of the Empire State, built on the River Hudson, at the head of its tide-water.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 126.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Albany,"Albany, New York",42.6521,-73.7525,Alfred Falk,1877,"Albany, after Jamestown in Virginia, is the oldest settlement in the original thirteen States. It was founded by the Dutch in 1612, and named by them Williamstadt, until 1664, when it fell into the hands of the British, and was re-named by them Albany, in honour of the Duke of York and Albany, afterwards James II. The city has a population of 80,000, and is a place of great commercial importance, from its position on the Hudson, and its proximity to the great Erie and Champlain Canals; the former of which gives it the command of a fine water-way to the west; and the latter, facilities of cheap water carriage to the north. It is also the centre of a large railway system. Albany is situated on a high ridge, and with its numerous spires, presents a very imposing appearance, when seen from the opposite side of the river. Statestreet, its principal thoroughfare, ascends from the water's edge to the height, on which stand the Capitol, and principal public buildings. The present State House is a plain, unpretentious building; but the new Capitol now in course of erection, in close proximity to it, will be, when completed, the finest edifice in the whole country; with the exception alone of the Federal Capitol at Washington. The State Library is a fine building, containing 90,000 volumes; and amongst other historical relics and curiosities, the original Arnold and André Correspondence. The City Hall is a beautiful white marble structure, with a fine portico, supported upon six Ionic columns. Albany possesses several public libraries, museums, and establishments devoted to educational purposes; amongst the latter may be mentioned the Normal School, for the training of teachers. Its churches are numerous, and many of them are handsome structures.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 126-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
New York City,"New York City, New York",40.7338,-73.9855,Alfred Falk,1877,"The City of New York, the commercial metropolis of the United States, and the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, is situated at the mouth of the Hudson, and occupies the whole extent of Manhattan Island; which is thirteen and a half miles long, by a width varying from a few hundred yards to two miles and a quarter. It also takes up a portion of the mainland, and three small islands in East River—viz., Randall's, Ward's, and Blackwell's. The area of New York is forty-one and a half square miles, of which twentyone and a half are on Manhattan Island, nineteen on the mainland, and about three quarters of a mile on the smaller islands. Its greatest length is sixteen miles, and its greatest width four and a half. It is separated from the City of Brooklyn by a branch of the Hudson called East River; and from its other leading dependency, Jersey City, by the Hudson proper. The older portion of the city is irregularly laid out; the larger and newer portion is more regular. The streets running the length of the island are called avenues, and are numbered from First upwards; the cross-thoroughfares bear the name of streets, and are numbered from First and go up to 225th. The buildings between two streets form a block, and twenty-one blocks, including the roadway, measure a mile. I was much struck with the English appearance of the city, and subsequently observed this to be a feature of all the great cities of the Eastern States; notably of Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 136-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Brooklyn,"Brooklyn, New York",40.6797,-73.9463,Alfred Falk,1877,"Brooklyn, though a distinct city with separate municipal officers, is generally regarded as a dependency of New York; many of the merchants having their counting-houses in the latter, and residing in the former. It covers an area of twenty square miles, and contains a population of half-a-million. It is often called the “City of Churches” on account of the great number of its religious edifices; and it otherwise possesses many fine public buildings. Prominent amongst the latter, are the City Hall, a marble edifice of the Ionic order; the Court House, another marble building of Corinthian architecture, with a fine portico anddome; the Academy of Design; and the Mercantile Library; the latter, a fine Gothic building, with reading-rooms, and 40,000 volumes. Prospect Park is a large, and fine recreation ground, covering 550 acres of ground. The view from here, of the cities of New York, and Brooklyn; of the harbour, with its shipping; and the rivers, with their islands; is very fine. It is beautifully laid out, somewhat after the style of Central Park; but is more densely timbered, and its large meadows, shut in by wooded hills, give it a distinct individuality.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 147.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",42.3571,-71.0628,Alfred Falk,1877,"Boston, the capital of the Old Bay State as Massachusetts is sometimes called, and chief city of New England, is situated on Massachusetts Bay and comprises Boston proper, East Boston, South Boston, Roxbury, and Dorchester. The city proper covers a peninsula only 700 acres in extent, and is consequently very closely built upon. East Boston occupies Maverick's Island, and having the greatest depth of water, at its wharves lie all the ocean steamers, and vessels of large draught. Some of these wharves are of considerable extent, that belonging to the Cunard Company being over 1,000 feet long. South Boston extends for about two miles along the south side of the harbour, by an arm of which, it is separated from Boston proper. The city is connected with Charlestown, one of its suburbs, by the Charles river bridge 1,5000 feet long; and with Cambridge, another of its suburbs, by the West Boston bridge 2,750 feet in length. The harbour covers an area of about seventy-five square miles, and is studded with numerous islands, which give it a very picturesque appearance. It is memorable for having been the scene of the occurrence, that led to the battle on the neighbouring heights of Bunker Hill, the actual beginning of the Revolutionary War, the results of which have been perhaps more important, than those of any other historical event. This occurrence, as is well-known, was the destruction, by a party of Bostonians disguised as Indians, of the obnoxious tea, attempted by the Home Government of the,day to be forced upon the colonists. Boston is one of the oldest cities in the States, having been founded in 1625, a few years after the settlement of New York. In 1872, it was the scene of an immense conflagration, which caused great devastation, destroying about 800 of the best buildings, which have however in an incredibly short space of time, been replaced by other, and better edifices. It is very much like an English provincial city in appearance, and is without doubt the most old-fashioned town in the States; the streets being mostly narrow and crooked, especially in the older part. Washington and Tremont Streets are the principal business thoroughfares, and contain many fine shops, and other buildings. Since the fire the streets generally have been widened, and otherwise improved. Boston has often been called the “Athens of America,” from Harvard University, the most ancient seat of learning in the country, being in its immediate vicinity; and from its possessing many other institutions devoted to higher learning. The pride of its New England inhabitants is proverbial, and was exemplified after the great conflagration; when Chicago and other towns collected by voluntary contribution, and forwarded a sum of £40,000, for the use of the people rendered homeless; which the Bostonians refused to accept, on the plea that they were rich enough to support their own poor. The public buildings of Boston are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; the most prominent are the State House, and the City Hall. The former is a building in the Grecian style of architecture, with an imposing colonnade in front, and surmounted by a gilded dome. The entrance leads directly into the Rotunda, in which are a fine statue of Washington, busts of former-governors, and trophies of banners and cannon. The City Hall is an imposing building of white granite, in the Italian Renaissance style, with a fine louvre dome. On the lawn in front is a fine bronze statue of Franklin.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 153-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Hartford,"Hartford, Connecticut",41.7654,-72.6756,Alfred Falk,1877,"After spending a few days in viewing the lions of Boston, I left by the New York and New Haven Railway for Hartford, which, until last year alternated with New Haven as the capital of Connecticut, but which has now been made the sole metropolis. It is one of the prettiest of the many pretty New England towns, lying in the valley of the Connecticut River, at the head of its navigation and junction with Park River; the country in the vicinity being rich, cultivated plains, interspersed with well-wooded hills, and dotted with villages and homesteads. The town itself is regularly laid out, some of the streets running parallel with the Connecticut river and being crossed by others at right angles; it is divided into two portions by Park river, which is spanned by numerous bridges. Main Street, the principal thoroughfare, presents for about a mile an unbroken front of shops, public buildings and churches. The city proper is connected with its suburb East Hartford, by a fine iron bridge over the Connecticut river 1,000 feet long. Hartford boasts a fine public park, covering forty six acres of ground, prettily situated on the banks of Park River; at the upper end of which, are the buildings of the Episcopal College of the Holy Trinity, the leading educational institution of the city, and one of the most important in the State. The course of instruction at Trinity College is similar to that at Yale; but more attention is paid to religious studies. There are about a hundred students in residence, and a staff of about twenty able professors. Divine Service is held twice daily, at which the attendance of the undergraduates is compulsory; and attached to the College is a fine Library of 7,000 volumes, where the mitre, which belonged to Bishop Seabury, is preserved as a relic,—such ornaments not being used in the American Episcopal Church. The College buildings are three in number, and are plain, substantial stone structures; but a new site for the College has been purchased, and it is intended to erect better and more suitable edifices.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 160-1.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Providence,"Providence, Rhode Island",41.8204,-71.4142,Alfred Falk,1877,"Leaving New Haven by the Stonington and Providence Railway, the road lies for some distance along the shores of Long Island Sound, through well-cultivated country; and after passing the important towns of New London, Stonington, and Westerly, we arrived at Providence, one of the capitals of Rhode Island, the smallest of all the States in the Union. This city is situated on an arm of Narrangansett Bay, called Providence River, and is, after Boston, the most populous and wealthy city in New England. It is a remarkably pretty place, the prettiest in fact of all the New England towns. The river flows into the centre of the city, where it expands into a fine lagoon, nearly a mile in circumference; and round this a park has been formed, planted with beautiful elms; in addition to which there are numerous greens or squares, and a pretty park of 100 acres, called after the founder of the city Roger Williams, by a descendant of whom it was presented to the citizens. The land upon which Providence is built, is somewhat hilly; and therefore unlike the flat monotony of New Haven, it presents a diversity of appearance, rendered picturesque by the hills being covered with fine residences. The principal business thoroughfare is Westminsterstreet, and from it extends the Arcade, one of the lions of the city, of which the people of Providence are very proud. This Arcade is 225 feet long and 80 feet wide, and has three stories containing shops; it is entered at either end through an imposing Doric portico. On the heights at one end of the town, are the six buildings of the Brown University, an old, and one of the best educational institutions in New England. These buildings stand in extensive grounds, and contain a large library and art collection. The public buildings of Providence are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; several now in course of erection, when completed, will materially add to the architecture of the city. In the centre of one of the squares, stands a very fine monument of granite, with five large bronze statues, erected to the memory of those Rhode Island soldiers and sailors, who fell in the Civil War. On this monument are inscribed the seventeen hundred and odd names of those it commemorates. Providence contains a population of over 100,000, and is the most important railway centre in New England, and the seat of many manufactures; the principal being cotton and woollen goods (it being the leading American market for “prints”), the Gorham-plate, the Peabody rifles, and the celebrated Corliss engines.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 164-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",39.9537,-75.1685,Alfred Falk,1877,"Philadelphia, the old Quaker City of Brotherly Love, as its name implies, is the largest in the States, in point of area, and the second in population. It is situated between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, about six miles above their junction; at present contains about 350 miles of paved streets, and a greater number of houses than any other city in America. It is very regularly laid out, the streets all running north and south, or east and west; the former are numbered successively from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, commencing with First Street, and going up to Twenty-third, and as the city has outgrown its former limits, they are now continued on the other side of the Schuylkill and proceed for a great distance. The houses in the streets running east and west, which have mostly pomological names, as Chestnut Street, Walnut Street, Vine Street, Filbert Street, &c., are all numbered from east to west; all between First and Second Streets, being numbered from 100 to 200, and all between Second and Third Streets, from 200 to 300, and so on. This is a system that might advantageously be carried out in all new cities, as it enables a stranger to find his way about very easily. For instance, if the nearest house be 940 then the visitor knows he is between Ninth and Tenth Streets; and in like manner, as all the numbered streets running north and south are allowed a hundred numbers, for each block distant from Market Street, the centre of the city; a stranger has only to learn the cardinal points, and he can calculate to a nicety, his distance from the Delaware or Market Street. The streets however are not wide, and in spite of their regularity, Philadelphia cannot be called a fine city; especially as its public buildings are not so imposing as those of many less important places. Like Boston, it much resembles an English city, and the inhabitants generally have an old-country look. The great feature of Philadelphia is Fairmount Park, one of the largest in the world, covering a space of 2,740 acres, extending for seven miles on both sides of the Schuylkill River, and Wissahickon Creek. It is nearly fourteen miles in length, and possesses great natural beauty; though up to the present time, little has been done towards its improvement. Within the park are situated the reservoirs that supply the city with water, which latter is brought from the Schuylkill, and forced up to the reservoirs by hydraulic power. Fairmount also contains a colossal bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln, and a small Art gallery in which are a few very fine pictures. Adjoining, is the new Zoological garden, which has only recently been formed, but which already contains a good collection of animals. The grounds are well laid out, and the various houses for the animals are very elegant structures. There are some pretty squares in the city. Logan Square contains seven acres, nicely arranged; Washington Square is enclosed by a handsome iron railing, is very well kept, and contains a specimen of every kind of tree that will grow in this climate, whether indigenous or not. Franklin Square has a fine fountain in the centre, and has a very trim appearance. Rittenhouse Square is in the aristocratic portion of the city, and is surrounded by fine mansions. The principal streets are Chestnut Street, which contains the best retail establishments; Market Street, the principal business thoroughfare; and Broad Street, containing the principal private residences and churches. Other leading thoroughfares are Lombard, Arch, Race, Vine, and Third Streets.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 168-171.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Baltimore,"Baltimore, Maryland",39.2918,-76.6092,Alfred Falk,1877,"After having spent a couple of weeks in Philadelphia, I was soon conveyed by rail to Baltimore, the chief city of Maryland, and in population and commerce, one of the principal in the United States. The scenery on the route from Philadelphia to Baltimore is uninteresting, although numerous well-cultivated farms, and many thriving towns are passed. Amongst the latter may be enumerated Chester, the oldest town in Pennsylvania, it having been settled by some Swedes in 1643; Wilmington, the capital of the State of Delaware with a population of over 30,000, and the seat of many important industries; and Newark, a pretty little place, containing the well-known Delaware College. Shortly after leaving the latter place, the train crosses the celebrated Mason and Dixon's line, so long the boundary between the Northern and Southern States. At Havre de Grace we crossed the beautiful Susquehanna River, with its numerous pretty islands, on a bridge nearly a mile in length. This has been erected in place of the one destroyed by the Confederate soldiers in the late Civil War, for the purpose of cutting off the Federal communication with Washington. Baltimore is situated on the Patapsco River, about fourteen miles from the entrance to Chesapeake Bay; its harbour is very capacious, and consists of an inner and outer basin, protected by Fort McHenry. The city is very much like a large English provincial town in appearance, and cannot by any means be called pretty; the streets being narrow, and closely built upon; but it is one of the cleanest towns in America. The inhabitants, who pride themselves upon being the handsomest people in the States, are quiet and orderly; and the town generally has a more homely appearance than is usually the case with American cities. Altogether I would as soon live in Baltimore, as in any town in the United States. Baltimore is sometimes called the “Monumental City;” why,—it is difficult to imagine; because it only possesses three Monuments, which are however very fine. The Washington Memorial is a Doric shaft 176 feet in height, resting on a huge pedestal, and supporting a colossal statue of Washington; it forms a very imposing landmark. Battle Monument, erected to the memory of those, who fell in defending the city in 1814, when attacked by the British, is also a fine column in the form of a Roman Fasces, surmounted by a female figure representing Baltimore, the base being in the form of an Egyptian temple. There is also a fine statue erected in honor of Thomas Wildey, the founder in the States of the order of Odd Fellows. The principal edifice in the city is the new City Hall, one of the finest municipal buildings in the country. It is built entirely of white marble, in the composite style, surmounted by an immense dome; but it stands in a narrow street, where its fine proportions are not seen to advantage. The Exchange is a fine building, having on its two façades colonnades of six Ionic columns, the shafts of which are single blocks of marble of admirable workmanship. It is crowned by a large cupola, beautifully frescoed in the interior, and contains a fine reading-room. In this building are the Post Office, the Custom House and the Merchants' Bank. The Baltimore Athenæum is a fine institution, with a library of 26,000 volumes. The Peabody Institute is a fine white marble building erected by the late George Peabody the well-known philanthropist; it contains a free library of 56,000 books, and in connection with it, is an Academy of Arts.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 217-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Annapolis,"Annapolis, Maryland",38.9784,-76.492,Alfred Falk,1877,"I availed myself of an opportunity that offered to proceed down the Patapsco River, and Chesapeake Bay, to visit Annapolis the capital of Maryland. The view of Baltimore from the river is very picturesque, and the trip down the Bay is most pleasant. Whilst at Annapolis, I visited the Senate Chamber in the State House, memorable for being the room, in which Washington resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief of the forces, into the hands of Congress; after the objects of the Revolution had been attained. It contains a fine painting commemorating this scene; and Washington's address, and the reply of Congress, are also to be seen. The principal Naval College of the United States is at Annapolis; the buildings, situated in extensive grounds, seem to be excellently well adapted for the purpose, and the internal arrangements are said to be very good. In addition to an ordinary wooden training-ship, there is an iron Monitor in connection with the College; so that the cadets are practically trained in the management of that class of war vessel.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 221.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
"Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C.",38.8998,-77.0319,Alfred Falk,1877,"Returning to Baltimore, I took train for Washington, the political metropolis of the Republic. Washington is situated on the north bank of the Potomac River, within an area of ten square miles, reserved for the Capital, in the District of Columbia. This Federal District of Columbia contains about sixty square miles,—its chief cities being Washington, the capital of the Union, and Georgetown. The object of making a Federal district, in which to place the capital of the country, was, to prevent any one State from exercising undue influence, by having the metropolis within its jurisdiction. The old law-makers of the Republic, in its early days, seem to have regarded this point as very essential to the common weal; and jealously watched that no one State gained an ascendancy over the others, in the Councils of the country. They had also in view the dangers of centralization, and in every case, second-rate towns were made the political capitals of the different States; so that, at the present time, it is seldom the capital of the State is at the same time its chief city. It is a singular anomaly, that Washington, the centre as it were of a purely democratic republic, has neither part nor lot in the authority to which it is subject. It sends no member to Congress, being in this respect less favourably situated than the Territories, which do return delegates to speak, if not to vote. The District of Columbia, in short, has taxation without representation. The city of Washington, originally designed by A. Ellicott, during the presidency of Washington, who by the way wished it to be called “The Federal City,” was laid out on a very grand scale, as it was anticipated that it would become an immense metropolis. This has, however, not proved the case, as the city has no commercial importance: it has consequently a ridiculously straggling appearance, and in it, palaces alternate with buildings that may comparatively be termed shanties. It is built on the rectangular parallelogrammic plan so common in America. The streets are all wide, and shaded by fine trees, and are divided into numbered streets, lettered streets, and avenues: thus, First, Second, and Third streets are crossed at right angles by A, B, and C streets; whilst the avenues, named after the different States of the Union, form the main arteries of the city. The principal of these is Pennsylvania Avenue, especially that portion which extends from the White House to the Capitol, and in it are situated most of the public buildings; whilst the best retail establishments are in Seventh street. The city contains a population of about 110,000 inhabitants; but this number is much increased during the sessions of Congress, when it swarms with political agents, needy office-seekers, and general hangers-on. The great feature however, of Washington, is its public buildings, foremost among which, stands the grand Capitol, one of the largest, and of its kind perhaps the finest edifice in the world. It crowns the summit of Capitol Hill, and consists of a main or central building, 352 feet long, and 121 feet deep, and two wings each 238 feet by 140 feet, covering together 3½ acres of ground. It may be said to be three distinct Grecian temples, each having a rich Corinthian portico, the centre one being surmounted by an immense dome, which altogether dwarfs its noble proportions, and which though painted to resemble marble, is constructed of iron. The central building is constructed of light yellow freestone painted white; the two extensions are of pure white marble, and the general appearance is severely classic, although it has a great fault, inasmuch as it fronts up hill, and its principal façade is turned away from the City. It stands within some thirty acres of grounds, beautifully laid out, and adorned with statuary; and in front of the building stands Greenough's colossal statue of Washington.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 221-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Cincinnati,"Cincinnati, Ohio",39.1244,-84.5173,Alfred Falk,1877,"Cincinnati, founded in 1788, and consequently a little under a century old, is certainly the most picturesque of the great cities of America; it is situated on the Ohio River, at this point about twice as broad as the Thames at Hungerford Bridge; its waters, yellow as those of the Tiber, here separating the State of Ohio from the adjoining one of Kentucky. On the Kentucky side of the river opposite Cincinnati, and connected with it by a magnificent iron suspension bridge 2,250 feet in length, the span between the towers being over 1,000 feet, are the cities of Covington and Newport. The view from the surrounding hills, of the three cities and the winding river, is very fine. Cincinnati is built on two terraces, rising one above the other, at a good elevation above the river; and being entirely surrounded by hills on three sides, thus lies in an amphitheatre; and this position gives it a picturesque variety of scenery, the want of which is so apparent in the majority of the large American cities. It is regularly laid out, the streets being broad, well paved, and crossing one another at right angles; although they are not as clean as they might be. This, by the way, is a failing common to all the cities of the Western States. The business portion of Cincinnati is compactly built, the buildings being for the most part of a dark freestone, which gives them a substantial appearance; the private residences are situated on the upper terrace, and on the hills in rear of the city. Fourth street is the fashionable promenade, and contains the finest shops. In Pearl street are the principal wholesale warehouses; and these being generally uniform high stone buildings, have a very imposing appearance. Third street contains the banks and insurance offices. There are, besides, many fine streets with beautiful private residences. A prominent feature in the city, is the beautiful Tyler-Davidson Fountain, erected at a cost, it is said, of £440,000, by Mr. Davidson, and by him presented to the citizens. It is of bronze, of exquisite workmanship; but it was cast in Munich, and though creditable alike in design and execution, it certainly cannot be regarded as a specimen of American art. The population of Cincinnati now approaches a quarter of a million of inhabitants, a third of which are either German or of German parentage, and occupy a portion of the city north of the Miami Canal, or the Rhine as they have re-named it. Crossing this canal, one finds oneself in seemingly quite a different country; no other language but German being heard, and the general appearance of the houses, and more especially of the numerous beer gardens, reminding one forcibly of the Fatherland. The Government buildings do not call for special mention; the County Court House being the only one with any pretensions to architectural design, but there are several very excellent charitable institutions, amongst which the Cincinnati Hospital and the Longview Asylum for the Insane are prominent. The city too is particularly well provided with firstclass educational establishments, many of them of a very high order. The principal church edifice in the city, is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Peter, a fine building in pure Grecian style with a high spire, and a portico supported upon ten columns.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 236-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Louisville,"Louisville, Kentucky",38.2341,-85.7555,Alfred Falk,1877,"From Cincinnati I proceeded down the Ohio to Louisville. The view from the steamer on starting was very fine; on the one side the city rose, terrace above terrace, towards the hill-tops, which, covered with villa residences, and vineyards, formed a beautiful semi-circular background; whilst on the other side lay the twin cities of Covington and Newport, nestling at the foot of the Kentucky Hills. The river scenery is uninteresting; towns being at great distances apart, and separated by large tracts of virgin woodland, or plains, which have a great sameness, and tend to make the trip monotonous. The land on the upper Ohio, above Cincinnati, is said to be under cultivation, and to be of a more diversified character, with pretty homely scenery. Below Cincinnati, the river, which had hitherto formed the boundary between the States of Ohio, and Kentucky, makes a sudden bend, and becomes the dividing line between the States of Indiana and Kentucky. Lawrenceburg and Aurora passed by the steamer are flourishing little towns in Indiana, and have a rather considerable shipping trade. Big-Bone Lick on the Kentucky side, is so called from a quantity of mastodon bones having here been found. Carrollton stands at the junction with the Ohio of the Kentucky river, which is navigable for about 200 miles, and possesses very picturesque scenery. Madison one of the principal cities in Indiana presents a very imposing appearance from the river; it is well built and is a place of importance, having a large commerce. Approaching Louisville the view becomes very fine; the river, here about a mile wide, is crossed by an immense bridge, which connects the Northern and Southern railway systems; whilst the view of Louisville on the one side, and of Jeffersonville on the other, is really imposing. Louisville, the chief city of Kentucky, is situated on a plain surrounded by hills, on the Ohio, near the junction with that river of the Bear-Grass creek. Opposite the city are the falls of the Ohio, which are very picturesque, being a succession of small cataracts, extending right across the river, but which disappear when the water is high. To prevent the navigation of the Ohio from being impeded when its waters are low a canal has been constructed round the falls, at great cost, to a place called Shippingport. The city covers an area of thirteen square miles, with a frontage to the river of three miles, and is laid out with great regularity; the streets being straight, wide, well-paved, and shaded by fine trees, but like those of Cincinnati they might with advantage be kept cleaner.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 239-41.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Saint Louis,"Saint Louis, Missouri",38.6352,-90.2345,Alfred Falk,1877,"St. Louis, the metropolis of the West, and the chief city of the State of Missouri, is situated on the Mississippi River, about twenty miles below its confluence with the Missouri, and 170 miles above its junction with the Ohio. Its position is unrivalled; situated on a river, that, with its tributaries commands half the traffic of the whole country; in close proximity to enormous tracts of the best agricultural land, and to almost boundless forests of fine timber; with inexhaustible resources in its coal and iron deposits; there would appear to be no limit to the future greatness of this city. Its progress hitherto has been so rapid, equalled only by that of its great rival Chicago, that it seems destined in time to become, the greatest of American cities....St. Louis is built on three terraces, rising one above the other from the water's edge, and is, in spite of its smoke, and dust, one of the finest cities in America. It extends along the river for a distance of eleven miles, and covers an area of 21 square miles; the business portion being densely built, and the whole river-front embanked, and forming a Levee, as wharves are called in America. Built for the most part of stone, the city has a very substantial appearance, and is laid out with great regularity, the streets near the river running parallel with it and further back, being at right angles to those that cross them.The streets running north and south, or parallel with the river, are numbered First, Second, Third, etc.; those extending from east to west have mostly pomological names; and the houses, being all numbered on the Philadelphia plan, it is easy to calculate one's distance from Market street, the centre of the city, or from the Levee. Front street extending the whole length of the Levee, contains fine blocks of warehouses, and together with First and Second streets, is the centre of the wholesale trade of the city. Fourth street is the principal promenade, and in it are the finest shops; whilst the private residences are in the avenues, and in Pine, Olive, and Locust streets.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 242-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Cairo,"Cairo, Illinois",37.0071,-89.176,Alfred Falk,1877,"We soon aproached the city of Cairo, which is situated on the Ohio, just above its junction with the Mississippi. Cairo is built on a bank of slimy mud. As the steamer approached the desolate embankment, which seemed the only barrier between the low land on which the town is built and the waters of the great river rising above it, it certainly was difficult to imagine that sane men, even though they be speculators, could have fixed upon such a spot, on which to place the site of a city—an emporium of trade and commerce. The town itself is a collection of brick houses and wooden shanties, and the streets are rendered almost impassable by mud. A more desolate-looking place cannot be conceived. Surely Dickens must have had Cairo in mind, when he described the flourishing town of Eden.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 251-2.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Memphis,"Memphis, Tennessee",35.1459,-90.0408,Alfred Falk,1877,"The next day we reached Memphis, in the State of Tennessee, 420 miles below St. Louis. This flourishing new city stands on a yellow bluff, thirty feet above the highest floods, and is already a place of much importance. It extends for several miles along the high banks of the river, though it does not run far back. The streets are at right angles to the principal thoroughfares, which are parallel to the river. In the centre of the town is a green square planted with trees, which seems a place of great resort by the citizens. The lofty stores and warehouses, the rows of shops on the broad street along the river, and the number and size of the public and private edifices, attest the results of the development of commerce created in a great measure by the Mississippi. Memphis is the outlet of a large cotton district, and exports 400,000 bales annually. It has fine public buildings and hotels, a theatre, eighteen churches, two medical colleges, five daily and three weekly newspapers, besides numerous banks and insurance offices. It is connected by railway with New Orleans, Charleston, Louisville, and Little Rock; and possesses foundries and manufactories of boilers and machinery. Its population is estimated at something over 30,000. During the War of Secession it fell into the hands of the Federal forces after the fall of Island No. 10, in 1862, and was the base of military operations for the capture of Vicksburg. Memphis is a wonderful place, and impressed me with the idea of progress more than any other place in the States. I was perplexed and amused by the mixture of whites, negroes, and of the semi savage, degraded by his contact with the white man; by the contrast between the gigantic steamer and the “dug-out” of the black man, which are to be seen in close proximity on the river; by the roll of heavily-laden drays and the rattle of cars in the streets, and at all the phenomena of active commercial life, being included in the same scope of vision that takes in, at the other side of the Mississippi, lands scarcely yet settled, and some that remain in the same state as they were centuries ago.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 253-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Vicksburg,"Vicksburg, Mississippi",32.3164,-90.889,Alfred Falk,1877,"The next day we reached Vicksburg, which is about 400 miles distant from New Orleans and 120 from Natchez, and which stands on a high bluff of yellow clay on the left bank of the river. Seen from the river with the remains of its great earth-works, and with the Court House and the spire of the Roman Catholic Church on the highest points, Vicksburg has a somewhat imposing and even picturesque appearance. Vicksburg is the largest town, though not the capital of the State of Mississippi, and its exports of cotton before the war amounted to 100,000 bales per annum. It was strongly fortified in 1862 and provided with a numerous garrison. In January 1863 it was attacked by the Federal naval force from Memphis and New Orleans, but without success. In April 1863 a naval attack was combined with the land forces under General Grant, who defeated General Pemberton near Jackson, cut off supplies and reinforcements for the garrison, and with a close siege and continual assaults compelled a surrender on July 4th 1863, with 30,000 prisoners, 200 cannon, and 70,000 stand of arms. From the natural strength and importance of its position Vicksburg has often been called the “Quebec of the Mississippi,” but the town itself is miserable, the streets for the most part being unpaved, and the buildings irregular, and generally constructed of wood or brick. From the terrace of the Court House, the view of the river, and of the vast tracts of forest, extending as far as the eye can reach, is, however, very fine. A little above the town, situated on a hill that slopes gently down to the river, is a cemetery in which repose the bodies of more than 30,000 Federal soldiers, an awful memorial of that terrible fratricidal war, called by some Americans “a little family quarrel.” Vicksburg is a place of much commercial importance and contains about 10,000 inhabitants.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 255-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
New Orleans,"New Orleans, Louisana",29.9467,-90.072,Alfred Falk,1877,"New Orleans the political and commercial metropolis of the State of Louisiana, is situated on both sides of the Mississippi, but principally on the left, about 100 miles above its mouth. Though large, it is anything but a fine city, being built on the alluvial banks of the river, on ground lower than the high-water level, and only protected from inundations by a levee or embankment of earth, four feet high and fifteen feet wide, that extends for a great distance on both sides of the river, and forms a pleasant promenade in the winter months. The water that percolates through this embankment and the natural drainage is conducted by open gutters, which run through the streets, into a swamp that lies between the city and Lake Pontchartrain, three miles distant. There is always the danger of the Mississippi making a breach in the embankment and pouring its waters into the city; besides which, Lake Pontchartrain has a nasty habit of backing up and inundating it, after the prevalence of certain winds. Thus New Orleans is unpleasantly situated between two waters; and the soil is so full of moisture that no excavations can be made. The largest buildings have no cellars below the surface; and in the cemeteries there are no graves, the dead being placed in tombs above ground. The older part of New Orleans is built within a great bend of the river, from which circumstance it derives its name of the “Crescent City.” It has however long ago overstepped its original limits, and now extends for a distance of about twelve miles along the river bank, presenting an outline somewhat like the letter S....The streets of New Orleans are very wide and handsome in appearance, though only the principal of them are paved. Those parallel with the river extend in an unbroken line, for a distance of about twelve miles; those at right angles to them, that run from the river to the lake, are also very regular. The streets that are not paved, are simply quagmires: in winter they are not practicable at all, and even in summer the dust makes them almost impassable. The open gutters form a bad feature of the streets of New Orleans; these have very steep sides, and are crossed at street comers by small bridges, consisting of single stones, and allowing two persons only to cross at a time.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 258-260.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Lake Pontchartrain,Lake Pontchartrain,30.1749,-90.0697,Alfred Falk,1877,"Leaving New Orleans by the Pontchartrain railway, I found myself within an hour on the steamer proceeding down Lake Pontchartrain, en route for Mobile. This lake is distant about five miles from New Orleans; its muddy waters teem with fine fish, and are covered with game of all kinds; it is forty miles long, twenty-five miles wide, and from sixteen to twenty feet deep. The shores are covered with dense forests of fine timber, chiefly pine and cypress, and abound with deer. The trip was somewhat monotonous, until we entered the channel called the Rigolettes, and passed Fort Pike, when the scenery became a little more diversified.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 266-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Mobile,"Mobile, Alabama",30.6931,-88.0445,Alfred Falk,1877,"Mobile, known also as the “Gulf City,” is the largest town and the only seaport in the State of Alabama; and is situated on the Mobile River, thirty miles distant from the Gulf of Mexico, in the midst of a sandy plain, bounded at the distance of a few miles by high hills. Though regularly laid out, with well-paved and delightfully shaded streets, I should say it is one of the dirtiest and most dismal towns in America. Government street however, the principal promenade, is a fine thoroughfare shaded by grand oaks, and containing many handsome private residences with beautiful gardens. There is too a public square, its walks well shaded by fine trees, that is also a nice feature of the town, and tends to modify its general dreariness. The only building in Mobile that calls for special mention is the Custom House, which also contains the Post Office; this is a handsome edifice built of granite. The City now contains a population of 40,000 and its principal business consists in the shipment of cotton, of which staple 350,000 bales are annually exported. There are also a few foundries and machine shops and other industries in the town.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 267-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Savannah,"Savannah, Georgia",32.0625,-81.1027,Alfred Falk,1877,"Savannah is without doubt the handsomest city in the South and perhaps in the whole of the States; for it is embowered in the luxuriant foliage of orange-trees, bananas, magnolias, stately palmettos, flowering oleanders, pomegranates, myrtles, bay and laurel trees. The private residences have mostly beautiful gardens, which are in constant bloom, and the city itself is laid out very regularly, the streets being wide, well-shaded, and crossing one another at right angles. A charming feature of Savannah too is the number of squares or greens at the intersection of the principal streets. These squares, twentyfour in number, vary in extent from two to three acres, and being situated equi-distant from one another, laid out in walks, and planted with evergreens and ornamental trees, assist materially in giving to the city, that appearance of tropical luxuriance of vegetation, that constitutes its great beauty. The position of Savannah, from a commercial point of view is very good. It is situated on the Savannah River, about eighteen miles above the point where it empties itself into the Atlantic; and it has become the second port in the States for the shipment of cotton. Its river-front is in the form of a crescent, extending a distance of about three miles, and all the large warehouses are here built on a narrow strip of land, that intervenes between the wharves on the river-front and the base of a steep bluff; thus their uppermost windows in the rear overlook a sandy plain on the top of this bluff, planted with rows of trees, which, under the name of “the Bay,” is the great commercial mart of the city.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 270-1.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Charleston,"Charleston, South Carolina",32.8055,-79.9455,Alfred Falk,1877,"Charleston is situated on a narrow spit of land formed by the junction of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, at the point where they enter the sea; it thus possesses three water frontages. It is now the principal city in South Carolina in size and commercial importance, and contains over 50,000 inhabitants. It is, for America, an old city, having been settled by an English colony in 1679. It played an important part in the Revolution, which obtained for the States their independence, and also in the first stages of Southern secession, the cause of the late civil war. The Harbour is an estuary about seven miles in length, extending to the Atlantic; it is almost land-locked, the entrance being only a mile in width. It is protected by strong batteries, the principal of which are Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, and Castle Pinckey; the former being situated on Sullivan's Island, at the entrance to the harbour on the right. Fort Sumter is now in ruins, and forms a picturesque feature of the harbour view; it is built on a shoal on the left side of the entrance, and commands the channel by which vessels enter. Castle Pinckey, covering the crest of a mud bank, is immediately in front of the town, being distant from it about a mile, and directly facing the entrance. It was here that open hostilities first commenced in the late war, when Fort Sumter was bombarded by the Confederates, who compelled the Federal garrison to surrender; and for a long time afterwards these fortifications were one of the chief points of Federal attack, Charleston is built on low flat land; extends a distance of three miles from north to south, and is laid out with some degree of regularity. There is no uniformity in the buildings, but the absence of regularity in this respect is more than compensated for, by the greater diversity; and as the houses are mostly detached, quaint in appearance, and surrounded by gardens containing the grand oaks, magnolias, and that luxuriant vegetation peculiar to the South; the town has a most picturesque appearance. Charleston suffered very much during the civil war, but since then, such progress has been made in the work of rebuilding, that it now shows but few traces of the great damage it sustained. King street is the principal thoroughfare and contains the best shops. In Meeting street are the warehouses in which the wholesale trade of the city is conducted, and the Banks and Insurance Offices are located in Broad street. The prettiest feature of Charleston, is a fine promenade called the Battery, situated at the water's edge, and surrounded by the best private residences. From it a magnificent view of the harbour is obtained. The country to the north of the city is very beautiful, and the drives in that direction along the banks of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers are most enjoyable, passing as they do, through rich tropical shrubbery.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 273-5.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Richmond,"Richmond, Virginia",37.5423,-77.4397,Alfred Falk,1877,"Richmond the chief city and political metropolis of Virginia, and during the civil war the capital of the Southern Confederacy, is situated on the James River, about 100 miles by water from Chesapeake Bay. During the war, great importance was attached to its possession by both the Federals and Confederates, and the former often attempted its reduction. The obstinacy however, with which it was defended, may be seen in the remains of the strong line of earthworks thrown up around it, and it was only surrendered after General Lee evacuated Petersburg in 1865. To prevent the tobacco warehouses and public stores from falling into the hands of the Federals, they, together with the bridges over the James River, were destroyed by fire. In this manner a considerable portion of the city was burned; but directly after the cessation of hostilities, the work of rebuilding commenced, and Richmond now presents but few tokens of the conflagration, and is rapidly regaining its former prosperity. The city, which is laid out with great regularity, is built on two eminences called Richmond Hill and Shocktoe Hill, separated by the Shocktoe Creek. Crowning the summit of the latter of these hills, and standing within a small park of some eight acres, is the State Capitol, a fine edifice with a portico supported on Ionic columns, the design for which is said to have been furnished by Thomas Jefferson, after that of the Maison Carrée , at Nismes, in France. Within this building is a life-size marble statue of Washington, erected by the Legislative Assembly of Virginia. Richmond contains some good public buildings, the best and most prominent being the City Hall, and the Custom House and Post Office, both of which are handsome structures. There are also several buildings, to which much interest attaches, from having been prominently connected with the late Civil War. Such are the Brockenbrough House, formerly the residence of Jefferson Davis when President of the Southern Confederacy, and the Libby and Castle Thunder Prisons, in which so many Northern prisoners languished in confinement.","Alfred Falk, Trans-Pacific Sketches: A Tour through the United States and Canada (Melbourne: George Robertson, 1877), 278-80.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Ottawa,"Ottawa, Ontario",45.4153,-75.6966,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"It is excellently situated, just opposite the magnificent group of Parliament Houses and other government buildings, all finely massed together on high ground commanding the river Ottawa. The next morning, which was again fine and warm, we started early on a voyage of discovery through the city, and, it being too early to find the Parliament Houses open, proceeded by train as far as the entrance to the grounds of Rideau Hall: a very small, unpretentious, and plainly-built house, with no good reception rooms, and altogether, we thought, quite unworthy to be the chief residence of the representative of the Queen in Canada. It is surrounded by a small, and not particularly ornamental garden, and woods containing no fine timber. There are pretty vistas, and a skating-pond and toboggan-slide—gay sights, we were told, in the winter; the house was being repaired, in the absence of its occupier at Winnipeg, and seemed in somewhat dilapidated condition. Each succeeding governor brings his own decorations—tapestry, pictures, etc., and carries them away with him at the termination of his appointment. After seeing the rather pretty Rideau falls, we trammed back to the city, and saw, the Chaudiere falls and lumber department; went over the exteriorly-fine and imposing Gothic Parliament Houses, built of a beautiful cream coloured sandstone, diversified with deep red—the whole presenting a rich effect of colour, enhanced by the beautiful green lawns in the midst of which it stands.

However, we managed to get a carriage, which took us to Victoria Park, and one of the great lumber yards, crammed with huge stacks of fresh smelling planks cut to various sizes, the produce of the great forests of Ontario, with a charming foreground of broad river and sand, beyond which, fringed with masses of tall trees of brilliant gold, towered the enormous and picturesque pile of municipal and parliamentary buildings, and the magnificent University of Toronto, with its superb central tower and many turrets, and Observatory, School of Science, Library, etc.; all of which we visited and greatly admired, as well as the too short time we had to spare allowed. The whole city is exceedingly well built of very handsome material; and its society, in refinement and cultivation of literature and science, is said to equal, if not surpass, its American rival, Boston called by some the Florence, by others the Athens, of the New World.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 16.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America

We were sorry to hear that English travellers mostly go to the hotels on the American side, across the river—unpatriotic of them and unwise; for the Canadian is by far the more impressive side to stay on. The American Prospect Park side is within a few minutes' walk of scenes beautiful and magnificent beyond description: you are close to the American rapids above the American Fall, and not very far from the Canadian rapids. But from the Canadian side you have before you, full in face, the entire panorama of all the falls, the Horseshoe, the Central, and the American. And you are within only five minutes' walk of the Great Iron Bridge, suspended at a giddy height above the boiling, seething, whirling waters below the American Fall, crossing over them to the American side, and along which, filled with awe and a sensation of terror, drenched with the spray, and deafened with the roar, you creep or drive nervously across—to find yourself at once in Prospect Park.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 17.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Canada,Northern America,North America
Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",41.8658,-87.6398,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"Chicago, I need not say, is built on a gigantic scale—huge, cyclopean, portentous—and sixty years ago consisted of a little village with less than one hundred inhabitants! Now, the towering buildings “scrape the sky”—some very handsome, and all imposing, from their bulk and extent, and the solid, massive granite of which they are built. The parks, especially Lincoln Park, are of vast extent and beautifully kept; long rows of brilliant flowerbeds, conservatories, fountains, statues, and monuments, particularly the magnificently placed, superbly colossal, monumental building in memory of Abraham Lincoln. It was too far to go to the site of the “World's Fair” of the previous year, nor would it have been worth while, most of the great exhibition buildings having been pulled down; nor did I care to see the Union Stockyards, which live pigs enter at one end as pigs, and come out in five minutes at the other as sausages. So I wandered contentedly over the gardens and parks, all admirably wellkept, and after seeing the City Hall, and some of the principal buildings and residences, returned to the “Auditorium,” which has a great theatre attached to it, for supper, before starting Westward ho!","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 27-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The “Queen City of the Plains” is one of the most wonderful examples of American growth and “push.” No thirty years ago it consisted merely of a small and straggling mining camp; now it is a wide-spreading and magnificent city, with grand public buildings, including a superb court-house seated on the high “Capitol” hill; long streets of immense width, delightfully shaded with cotton-wood and pepper trees, every street to the west ending in exquisite vistas of the blue Rockies; theatres, opera-house, numerous costly churches, a “city park ” of immense extent, containing lakes, conservatories, and a zoological garden—in short, a miracle of enterprise and rapid growth!

After leaving the car, we climbed to the highest point of the group of deep-red rocks, from which the winds had blown all the snow. A hutlike little inn stands here; now, unluckily, closed for the winter, and a small meteorological station, generally lived in all the year round. The whole panorama indescribably grand. The fantastic foreground of vivid crimson rocks; the glittering snowfields shining and sparkling in the radiant sunshine, shadowed here and there, in their depths, by fugitive sunlit vapoury mists of the heavenliest blue, deepening to purple; range upon range of vast mountain chains of loveliest form; and, towering high above all, the wild serrated ridge of the exquisite, for ever ice-bound Sangre de Cristo, in the dimmest distance, stretching from far north to south, one long, unending, windblown, uptossed sea wave as it were, frozen for ever to icy stone! To the west, great, desolate, up-heaved, violent red and yellow rock-masses, the lower rich wooded hills entirely hidden; whilst, deep down below, one vast, sunny plain of waving golden prairie stretches far as eye can reach, into vaguest, far-off, mysterious, misty light.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 35.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Salt Lake City,"Salt Lake City, Utah",40.7527,-111.8943,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"The streets are all of uniform and immense width, 132 feet, delightfully shaded by every kind of temperate fruit and flowering and ornamental tree, and are all at right angles to each other, ending in lovely deep blue, snow-crowned, mountain vistas. Every house, except in the more commercial streets, stands detached, surrounded by a well-dressed garden full of bright, sweet-scented flowers and fruit trees, whilst many of the larger residences dominate over quite a little park of their own, full of choice shrubs and trees intermixed with gorgeous flower beds. The Temple is surrounded by gardens beautifully laid out from the designs of Brigham Young, who although originally a bricklayer by trade, and illiterate, seems to have had much sense of artistic beauty. We next went to the Tabernacle, guided by a venerable and benevolent-looking Elder, with a long snow-white beard, who lost no opportunity of zealously crying up the excellence of his faith, which, he said, he was convinced, if duly expounded unto us and explained, we should inevitably embrace. This huge and ungainly building of elliptic form, entered by twenty doors, supports, on forty-four massive sandstone pillars a huge wooden roof shaped in imitation of the shell of a turtle, and seats comfortably 9,000 persons, several additional thousands finding standing room on important occasions. At one end of the ellipse a huge orchestral platform accommodates the ecclesiastical authorities, elders, and singers; opposed, at the other end, by an equally huge and very magnificent organ, built in the city. The whole of the flat central floor is covered with seats, and raised galleries of seats encircle the sides. Concerts are sometimes held here, the Mormons having had the privilege of listening on one occasion to the enchanting singing of Adelina Patti and other celebrities.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 47-50.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

By cable car, up and down almost, perpendicular streets, all bordered by lovely palms, eucalyptus, and locust trees; every house with its wide veranda covered with fragrant creepers in bloom, all basking in the golden sunshine; to the exquisitely-kept Golden-gate Park with its grand conservatories and lovely views, covering an area of more than 1,000 acres, admirably laid out with greenest turf and planted with every description of rare and beautiful shrub and tree and gorgeous flower beds. As soon as we could tear ourselves from the loveliness and innumerable walks and points of interest in the Park, we went on by the Ocean-beach Railway, to the magnificent Sutro Heights, crowned with enchanting gardens and shrubberies, overhanging the wide ocean, with its glorious lines of huge breaking waves thundering against the “Seal rocks” and beetling cliffs far below. A handsome villa stands high in the grounds, wreathed with brilliant flowers and creepers. The garden is simply an Eden! every imaginable delicate and lovely fern, bamboo and palm, flowers of every hue and fragrance, flowering and sweet-scented shrubs, mandarin and lemon trees with their charming pale-green foliage—over it all the deep blue sky and vivid golden sunshine.

The first sight of them, for the giants we had seen in the forest as we came along were mere pigmies compared with these, simply takes your breath away! It feels like an incredible dream! and this variety of the “Sequoia” ( Sequoia sempervirens ) is as beautiful as it is indescribably grand. The foliage is a glossy dark green, very like that of the yew in colour and form; the bark is a beautiful rich deep red, as also is the wood, and each tree consists of one magnificent huge central trunk, with immense and most picturesque red gnarled roots, out of which spring, all round the parent tree, ten or twelve younger smaller trees; that is, smaller as far as diameter of trunk goes, but in height these graceful and numerous off-shoots, as it were, from the roots, soar up into the sky two or three hundred feet, nearly as high as the central parent giant, which varies in diameter from fifteen to thirty feet. No words can express the beauty, the magnificent grandeur, of this glorious grove! Every single tree in it is a giant, and a giant with its attendant family of young giants, each separate tree consisting of a group of from twelve to fifteen. One of the central parent trees that we measured had a circumference of seventy feet, and others are still larger. Hours and hours one could spend, wandering from tree to tree, or rather, from tree-group to tree-group, through endless groves!

Yo Semite Valley,"Yosemite Valley, California",37.7442,-119.5824,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"ON every side, far as eye can reach, distant ridge upon ridge and icy snowfield; high snow-peaks and gigantic bluffs of granite so silvery-white as to give. the effect of snow, or purest Carrara marble. Immediately, and perpendicularly beneath you, deep down 5,000 feet below, hemmed in on all sides by stupendous vertical walls of frowning white granite crags, lies softly nestling an enchanted valley, narrow and long, shut in, in the opposite blue distance, by the misty, snow-clad “Cloud's rest;” shining fields of snow carrying the eye into the far-away, dim mystery of the horizon. In the heart of the valley, in deep sunshiny meadows, curving and winding like a serpent of silver, flows the shining Merced river; the bases of the snowy cliffs fringed with dark, solemn pines and feathery poplars of brilliant gold. Down to this haven of sunny rest the track is dangerous, and the whole steep, winding way overhangs fearful precipices; but fear is hushed in the absorption of the wondrous and ever-increasing beauty. At last the vale is reached, and looking upward you realize the tremendous and dizzy height of these vertical granite walls, dazzlingly white and smooth in parts, and rough and rugged in others. Here and there huge, detached masses, like Titans turned to stone; “cathedral spires” piercing to the skies; the entire valley one lovely, happy garden, cradled in crags. Groves of dark titanic pines, and the tender grace of delicate shrubs, and graceful trees softly waving their lovely foliage of every imaginable tint of green-gold, scarlet and pink, relieving and illuminating with a triumphant glory of dazzling colour the sternness of the unbending craggy heights; the whole exquisite scene steeped and bathed in the golden haze of the glowing, radiant noontide. Soon we pass the misty Bridal Veil, shedding its exquisite rainbowy fountains vaguely into the “happy valley,” transparent mists of loveliest blue rising to shadow and veil the gaunt protecting walls.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 89-90.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
Fresno,"Fresno, Callifornia",36.7379,-119.7855,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"Fresno, the head centre of the great vineyard section of California, is a well-built and very flourishing little city, with broad, tree-shaded streets, and a pretty park, in which stands a very grand city hall. I spent the time most agreeably in visiting several of the celebrated vineyards in the neighbourhood, in which are raised vast quantities of grapes dried as raisins for exportation; and walking about in the park and gardens, till alarming sounds of cannonading and firing of musketry terrified me into making the best of my way, through excited crowds, back to the comfortable little inn at tho depot, where I was informed that the row was not dangerous, but only in honour of the municipal elections which were to take place next day. Fresno is the“dinner depot,” with an excellent and very large restaurant, to which the principal inhabitants of the city seem “ abonnés ” for their meals. Every table simply groaned under the weight of grapes—huge, enormous bunches, perfectly delicious in flavour, unlike some varieties of Californian grapes. The object being to advertise the vine-growing capacity of the country, every passenger was pressed to eat as many grapes as possible, gratis; and when I left I was presented with a huge basket, almost too heavy to carry, full of this delicious fruit. This country is admirably irrigated, with water conveyed in canals from the inexhaustible supply in the mountains. I went on by the 6 p.m. train, so fearfully crowded that I was compelled to take refuge in my pet abhorrence, the “sleeper,” and at 7.30 next morning arrived at Los Angeles, through exquisite groves of oranges and lemons, peaches and mulberries—great quantities of the latter for the purposes of silkworm culture, which is now one of the most lucrative industries of California.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 99-100.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

Chihuahua,"Chihuahua, Mexico",28.6332,-106.0635,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"It was a lovely cloudless morning, the “Sabbath morning,” and we at once betook ourselves to the “casa Robinson,” to make something more of a “Sunday toilette,” and to breakfast. The “casa” is a large and airy whitewashed house, with, as in all Mexican dwellings, a central “patio” (court), planted with oleanders and orange trees, into which the various rooms open. Of course, after the wonderful hotels of the United States, the Mexican “fondas,” like those of Spain, fall short; but the rooms all shone with clean fresh whitewash, and an entire absence of disagreeable insect like; the wooden floors were perfectly well scrubbed; here and there rocked a chair, and the food was quite clean and eatable—the bread and chocolate, as in Spain, superlatively good. After breakfast we walked through very clean streets of whitewashed flat-roofed houses, shaded by rows of poplars, to the cathedral, for the high mass, where we saw a most picturesque crowd, the same sort of gaily-dressed men with their “rebosos” (toga-like mantles) and pretty children and women, gracefully dressed in shawls or mantillas, that you see in Spain; the same absence of seats of any kind, the same scrupulous and perfect cleanliness, the same antique-sounding, cracked organs, and short Spanish sermon. The cathedral itself is spacious and picturesque; it was built during the Spanish occupation, at the beginning of the last century, at a cost of 800,000 dollars raised by a tax on the neighbouring Santa Eulalia silver mines. After mass, we wandered in the lovely sunshine, through the prettily-situated city, with its fine park and gardens, full of oranges and myrtles, roses and palms, bordered with fine eucalyptus and many other trees—to the mineral baths, and a grand Spanish aqueduct, more than 200 years old, just outside the city walls, with lovely views, and the Guadalupe shrine. Then we returned in delicious, but not too hot, sunshine to the “casa,” where we dined— the usual kind of lesser Mexican food, which, however, I thought superior to the Spanish of the same grade, being happily innocent of garlic; after which, having arrayed myself in a black lace mantilla and fan “á la española,” we proceeded through the charming and extensive park to the Plaza de Toros, where a “funcion” takes place every Sunday afternoon.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 115-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

Still rising, higher and higher, with lovely vales below, till the highest point, 8,133 feet, is reached at Marquéz,, through rows and masses of agaves and yuccas and cacti, then descending a thousand feet or so to Tula, the ancient capital of the wonderful Toltec civilization, situated in the loveliest valley imaginable, gorgeous with flowers and exquisite foliaged trees glistening in the golden sunshine; through which we speed, coming into sight of the “Tajo de Nochis tongo,” a huge canal begun by the Spaniards in 1607, from 200 to 600 feet wide, and nearly 200 feet deep, for the purpose of draining the great lakes in the valley of Mexico. It was never finished, but there seems now some prospect of its continuation, at a proposed cost of eight million dollars. A little further on we see one of the most interesting sights in the world, the high-placed Valley of Mexico, with its distant ranges of hills and its two gigantic sentinels, rose-red in the last rays of the setting sun—the steep, pyramid-like Popocatepetl (“Hill that smokes”) rearing its sharp cone of snow, 17,780 feet into the blue, rose-flaked sky; and Ixtaccihuatl (“the white woman”) about 16,000 feet in height, but broader in shape, created, as it were, with a snow-white woman's form resting on its for ever cloud-wreathed summit.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 125-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

It is a very fine square, of great size, the centre of all the principal “callés” (streets), with a charming garden, the Zocola, well laid out with walks and ornamental trees and excellent turf, and flower-beds and seats in the centre; one side of the square entirely occupied by lovely groves, from which rises the grand imposing mass of the huge fortress-like cathedral, with a facade of 425 feet, a height of 180, and a length of 200 feet, consecrated in 1573. Two massive towers, 218 feet high, were added at the west end later, and were not completed till 1731. Several lesser tower-like projections, and two grand domes rising above capillas: the roof itself rising here and there into irregular, domelike projections, with the vastly solid and picturesque effect that is seen in all the great cathedrals of Mexico, and so many of those of Spain. The massive walls are much sculptured in the elaborately florid style of the later and inferior Spanish renaissance; but the general effect of the whole gigantic pile is exceedingly fine and imposing, towering high above all the surrounding, buildings, and forming a magnificent centre to the city: the beautiful trees and gardens that surround it adding immense charm to its general appearance. At the east end the cathedral is joined by the Sagrario, in which marriages and baptisms take place. It adds largely to the great mass of building, but its walls are decorated in the most debased “churriguresque” style. Another entire side of the plaza is occupied by the immense Palacio Nacional, 675 feet long, the city residence of the President of the Republic, which also includes most of the government offices. The whole of the side opposite to it is taken up by shops of various kinds, especially booksellers', interrupted by openings for two or three callés, and the City Hall. Opposite the cathedral the principal street, Callé de San Francisco, leads to the Alameda, a beech-shaded promenade with pretty gardens, in close proximity to the magnificent Pasco de la Reforma, where the beauty and fashion of the city disports itself on horseback and in carriages (unfortunately almost invariably closed) every afternoon from 4 till sunset, with the addition, on Sundays, of a “church parade,” from noon till 1 p.m. We wandered about, viewing the exterior of the cathedral from various points of view, till 10 o'clock, at which hour the Museo Nacional is to be seen till twelve. It is situated at the back of the Palacio Nacional, and is a large handsome building into which you enter through a great archway and hall, leading into an exquisite patio beautifully laid out with geometrically-shaped flower beds full of the loveliest and most brilliant flowers, and masses of rose trees and dwarf mandarins, all one sheet of bloom; the air filled with their delicious fragrance and the murmur of fountains of the clearest and most sparkling water, the hot sunshine tempered by giant palms, and two still more gigantic Poinsettia trees, dazzlingly resplendent in their superb scarlet foliage. You walk across the lovely garden, and enter through a wide archway into the huge oblong hall in which stand the wondrous monuments of Aztec civilization, and also those of its unparalleled brutality.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 129-130.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

One could fancy what must have been the dazzling effect, in the brilliant sunshine, of these barbaric but gorgeous warriors, clad in chain-armour of gold or silver, covering their inner, padded, cotton-quilted shirt, so excellent for defence, and adopted by the conquerors; their shoulders covered with mantles of exquisite feather-work, their heads adorned with gorgeous plumes, their faces masked with representations of birds or wild animals; their shining spears and glittering shields, and brandishing staffs shaped liked quadruple scythes, with formidable blades of tetzli (obsidian) sharpened to an edge nearly as trenchant as steel.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 152-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

The train winds in endless curves, up the steep gradient—at a foot's pace, luckily, so that there is time to see well—crossing wild gorges on curved bridges supported by trestles at fearful and dizzy heights, the slopes of the mountains covered with glorious vegetation; giant mahogany, zapote, rosewood, and cedar trees almost smothered in brilliant festooned masses of orchids, the air heavy with delicious aroma and perfume; the mountain-chains rising in stupendous masses above all this glory of foliage and flowers. Divine little humming-birds darting about, like coloured flashes of flame! bigger birds, feathered in every hue of the rainbow; over the Atoyac river, with its precipitous falls shaded with exquisite verdure; stopping from time to time at little stations filled with picturesque groups of Mexican women in their graceful blue draperies, carrying baskets brimming over with every variety of gorgeous and delicious fruit, which they offer for a few cents, with soft and caressing little cries of “ Nino! nina!” to attract attention—oranges, citrons, pineapples, bananas, pomegranates, grapes, figs, mango-manilla, and many other tempting and exquisite fruits that we had never before seen or heard of—also pulque, which did not tempt.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 165-6.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

So, mindful of the warning of the friendly doctor, we closed our windows and sat patiently in the train till, in due time, it moved on. For some time we had been coming into full sight of the great Pico de Orizaba (18,250 feet high, the highest of the North American mountains), towering its radiant dome of silver high into the soft blue skies, held up aloft, as it were, by mighty walls of rock, giant precipices, and chains of peaked massive mountains: soft, deep blue, vapoury mists playing and floating over their rugged crags, and the steaming forests of tropical vegetation beneath.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 166.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

It was dedicated to Quetzalcoatl (plumed serpent), god of the air, and representative of the planet Venus, whose black statue, resplendent with gold and jewels, and decorated with two crosses, stood enshrined in the magnificent teocalli erected on the broad platform of the prehistoric Mound—still the great object of archeeological, as in those days of religious, pilgrimage—built in the form of a truncated pyramid. The enormous square base—1,423 feet in length (double that of the great Pyramid of Ghizeh) covered a space of 44 acres, and was built in four diminishing terraces, the uppermost platform measuring more than one acre—its square sides each 165 feet long; it was anciently surmounted by the great teocalli dedicated to the god of air—destroyed and replaced, after the conquest, by the still extant church of “la Virgen de los Remedios”—the front of which commands a superb view of the rich plain and the great volcanoes, including the glory of Orizaba. The terraces of this famous pyramid are now so over-grown with vegetation as to be almost obliterated, but here and there can be distinguished; and a stone-paved winding road to the summit discovers, in its cuttings, alternate strata of clay and brick; but whether the interior of the mound was natural, or wholly artificial, is not known.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 172-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America

It was too late to see the interior, which was closed, so we walked round examining the beautiful exterior; then round the plaza with its many fountains and brilliant flower beds and rows of orange, lemon, and citron trees, and grand palms and exotic shrubs, listening to the charming music and watching the promenading citizens, poor and rich, in their gay and picturesque attire—the air balmy and warm, redolent of delicious perfume. We looked into several rich and brilliantly-lighted shops at the further end of the plaza, passing, on its opposite side, the huge and handsome block of buildings constituting the palacio del Gobierno, to our hotel, just round the corner, the “Gran Humboldt,” most comfortable, airy, and clean; all the bedrooms on the first floor opening on to a charming wide cloister-like brick terrace full of flowers and plants in tubs. It is entirely open on the four inner sides overlooking the central patio, which is of course open to the sky, and in which a fountain of many jets sprinkles and refreshes great orange and palm trees; roses and jasmine and flowering creepers twining round and up the supports and balustrades of the brick terrace, which is covered with little round tables gaily decked with flowers, where one takes one's meals al fresco.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 205-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,Mexico,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America
San Antonio,"San Antonio, Texas",29.43,-98.4848,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"The Americans are very proud of the city of San Antonio, as being one of their oldest, dating from about 1690, when it was built by the Spaniards: Texas at; that period having belonged to Mexico, under the rule of Spain. It still retains many of its Spanish features—the plaza de Alamo being surrounded by the principal buildings, amongst which the Spanish fortress-church of the Alamo is the great point of interest. In 1836 this fortified church was besieged by the Mexicans under General Santa Anna, Texas having declared for independence; and after twelve days of gallant resistance was carried by assault, and the whole of the little American garrison of 165 men, under Crockett, ruthlessly slaughtered. “Remember Alamo” became the American cry—fully avenged during the Mexican War. The plaza is adorned with fine groves of Alamo trees (cotton-wood), an opera house and the Federal Building. The San Antonio river winds in and out through the city, and the Plaza de las Yslas is prettily decorated with groves of orange trees, and the Plaza de Armas contains a fine city hall, and the cathedral, of somewhat imposing exterior but very poor interior. The climate is thought to be exceedingly agreeable and equable, and much recommended for consumptives. There are pleasant drives in various directions outside the town, especially those leading to the interesting old (for U.S.A. i.e. dating from about 1731) Spanish “missions,” two or three of which are extremely picturesque, mostly built of adobe, and in the usual solid castellated style with handsome cloisters, planted round with beautiful groves of trees and gardens. It was a lovely day, and very pleasant wandering among these Spanish memories, and the extensive parks and the green banks of the lazily-flowing river, and then to a more distant moorland where, we were told, we should find a lovely lake, which, after a long, long walk, turned out to be a very tiny one—a mere pond, in fact—but the whole scene pretty in the sunset rays.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 227-8.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Central America; Northern America; Latin America,North America
New Orleans,"New Orleans, Louisana",29.9404,-90.0828,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"It had been dark for some time before we reached New Orleans, so we went straight to the hotel, the “St. Charles,” from the roof of which is a splendid view of the city and the windings of the mighty Mississippi, with its thick and muddy waters, due to its junction with the turbid Missouri, not far from St. Louis, and next morning (December 6th) were ready to start at 5 a.m. to see as much of the city as possible during the few hours of our stay. Many of the streets are broad and well shaded with beautiful trees, and many lovely lemon and orange groves and gardens full of bright flowers adorn the squares. The Cathedral of St. Louis is imposing, and many of the public and other buildings are handsome, but the city did not strike us as an agreeable or healthy place to live in, most of it standing below the level of the river at high water, and having to be protected by an embankment fourteen feet high and fifteen wide, which does not always prevent its being nearly swamped. It is curious to think of this city and the whole State of, Louisiana, at that time of such gigantic extent—now divided into twelve great states and territories—sold to the United States by Napoleon I., in 1803, for fifteen million dollars! One quarter of the city remains entirely French, and prides itself on the great beauty and grace of its fair Creole inhabitants. A certain amount of dark Spanish beauty is also to be seen, but the painful negro race predominates over these and other European settlers. There are no parks to speak of, but the cemeteries are exceedingly fine and extensive, full of handsome monuments shaded by huge and magnificent magnolias and live oaks, and grand avenues of venerable cypresses with their hoary covering of gray Spanish moss.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 228-9.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America
St. Augustine,"St. Augustine, Florida",29.896,-81.3138,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"I started by train for St. Augustine, arriving at 10 p.m., and joined G. at the Cordoba, Hotel, in the grand plaza, which is beautifully laid out with lawns, fountains, and palms, orange and lemon trees, and beds of dazzling flowers; one whole side occupied by the huge and magnificent hotel “Ponce de Leon,” and another by the almost equally splendid “Alcazar”— neither of these yet open for the winter—and other fine buildings and villas embowered in flowers and gardens. In short, nothing of its kind could be finer or more gay 233 than this plaza, brilliant electric light and an exquisite moon shining upon its fountains and rich vegetation, and still more lovely next morning in brilliant sunshine and radiant blue sky. The “Cordoba,” too, is excellent and very handsome. We breakfasted at 6.30 and then walked into the plaza and beyond it to Fort Marion, fine and extensive fortifications, guarded from inroad of water by it strong sea-wall, the whole built of “coquina”—it curious stone found in quarries on the beach, consisting entirely of minute portions of shells crushed into one solid mass—fronting the sparkling narrow arm of sea which divides the mainland from front the wooded island of Anastasia. The view from the high ramparts of Fort Marion (which took a century to build, and was begun by the Spaniards in 1656) is very pleasing. We were shown over the fort by a charming old soldier who, in his own person, constitutes the entire garrison, and who had seen much service, and had written an excellent little abridged history of Florida, entitled “Ponce de Leon land” in remembrance of the ill-fated discoverer of this flowery ]and, who —seven years before Cortes set foot in Mexico—in the loveliness of its flowery spring tide, landed here on April 3rd, 1512, that day being Easter Sunday—in Spanish the feast of “Pascua Florida”—to commemorate which he gave the land the name of Florida.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 232-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America; Caribbean; Gulf of Mexico,North America
Ormond,"Ormond Beach, Florida",29.2899,-81.0835,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"AT first the line turns inland, as far as Palatka, on the S. John's river, then outward again. till it touches the coast at Ormond—a very attractive sea resort. The aspect of the country is everywhere much the same. Pine forests, with occasional clearings for ranches surrounded by orange plantations, a soil of silvery, very fine white sand, densely covered with palmetto and wild orange trees. It is bright and pretty, but after a time becomes a little monotonous, except in the richer districts, where you simply revel in gorgeous fruit-land, and fancy yourself transported into the golden garden of the Hesperides. At Ormond begins the Indian River, so called, which is really not a river at all, but merely a still, motionless, salt-water lagoon, lying parallel with the ocean, with which it is connected by one or two narrow inlets, and from which it is divided by a narrow strip of land, for a distance of 218 miles, its breadth varying from about 100 yards to 6 miles. It is a dreamy, sheeny expanse of oily water, taking beautiful-reflections of exquisite shades of blue; and its banks are mostly clothed with rich vegetation—grand palms and magnolias, giant yuccas, fig trees, vines, and vast groves of orange trees, one glowing mass of golden, delicious fruit. In some parts, forests of grand pine, and huge cypresses overhung with their usual drapery of Spanish moss; with dense. undergrowth of palmetto, concealing under its bright green foliage savages, such as wild cats of hideous strength and ferocity, scorpions, “rattle” and innumerable other venomous snakes, and giant centipedes horrible to behold and deadly to feel, which everywhere abound in the wilder parts, where pumas and bears may occasionally be also seen. Nowhere are more deadly reptiles and insects found than in this bland and smiling Florida. From Ormond the train runs the whole way close to the edge of the flat western shore of the river, passing many prosperous little towns; the oily water taking exquisite tints of rose and scarlet as the sun sank low—its setting followed by a marvellous afterglow of vividest orange and crimson—fading suddenly into semi-darkness. At 10 p.m. we reached, in brilliant moonlight, Lake Worth, at the southern extremity of the river, where the train stops within a few yards of the immense and magnificent Hotel Poinciana, fronting the shining lake, and surrounded by exquisite terraced gardens and superb avenues and groves of graceful cocoa-palm and every variety of exotic shrub and tree and brilliant flower. Next day was a dream of tranquil, delicious, beauty—the charm of charms, to wander away to eastward, through groves of lemon and palm, and great aromatic shady trees, over a sandy path matted with flowers, guided and drawn by the ever-alluring song of the sea, only one little quarter of a mile away.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 236-7.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America; Caribbean; Gulf of Mexico,North America
Winter Park,"Winter Park, Florida",28.6029,-81.3519,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"A good little hotel here, where we had luncheon, and at 2 p.m. proceeded by train, an hour's journey, to Winter Park. Here the orange groves are perfectly superb—giant trees simply weighed down with fruit; huge grape-fruit (pomelo) trees, of which the fruit looks like golden cannon-balls, thousands ripe on each tree. Pomegranates, Japanese persimmons (a beautiful scarlet fruit), tamarinds, figs, mangoes, pintee (Chinese peach), kumguats, a delicious little fruit looking like a tiny orange, but belonging to the citrus family—in short, there is simply no end to the exquisite fruit plantations, all carefully placed at the right distance and watered and kept in the most admirable order, all the houses pretty and neat, each with its veranda embowered in brilliant flowers, inviting repose with its numerous rocking-chairs, and each with its surrounding fragrant and lovely garden. In this land of innumerable lakes, Winter Park of course is not without; and the pretty white-sanded shores that surround its pond are fragrant with exquisite lemon groves. In bathing in this and other lakes in Florida the risk has to be run of swarming insects, very minute, which burrow in the feet or legs of the bather, and there lay their eggs, with most unpleasant results, for it is almost impossible to extra them. After wandering for a long time in this true garden of the Hesperides, we went to the Hotel Rogers, a charming little house—one mass of jasmine and roses, daturas, and bignonias. A delightful wide balcony above, into which the bedrooms open, as well as below, full of flowers and rocking-chairs. A lovely garden all round, and indescribably beautiful and magnificent orange trees, literally covered with fruit in all stages of size and colour, from the most delicate shades of green and pale yellow to deep gold, the scent of the flowers too delicious for words. After dark, and we had returned from the most enchanting walk through this wonderful fruit-land, a violent thunder-storm came on, torrents of rain refreshing the beautiful trees, and still more bringing out their exquisite fragrance. Next morning the clouds had cleared, and the sky was blue and serene as ever, and the time passed rapidly and delightfully, wandering amid these endless groves of trees, as striking for their lofty and beautiful forms as for their incredible wealth of fruit; passing, among many fine villas, the huge Seminole Hotel, not yet open for the winter; sketching and visiting with our kind and hospitable landlady, Mrs. Rogers, her superb plantations of fruit trees.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 239-40.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America; Caribbean; Gulf of Mexico,North America
Tampa Bay,"Tampa, Florida",27.9342,-82.4756,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"At 10 p.m. we reached Tampa Bay, every moment vividly lighted up by the lightning, which continued to superbly illumine the sky the whole night. Fortunately the train, as itwere, drives up to the door of the great hotel, so we merely had to alight and run in, to find ourselves in a sort of Aladdin's palace. It accommodates with comfort 1,000 persons. Lofty and wide galleries rather than corridors, richly carpeted, the sides lined with rows of magnificent vases of every description of china and majolica, and superb cloisonné from China and Japan, holding the loveliest exotic plants and immense palms, tree-ferns and bamboos. The suites of “parlours,” exquisitely decorated and furnished; priceless French specimens, several of which had belonged to Marie Antoinette; tapestry and paintings, wonderful collections of old china, and choicest old Venetian glass—in short, a luxury and lavish magnificence that would be incredible were it not for the fact that Mrs. Plant, the wife of the millionaire head of the great “Plant line” of railroads and steamers to which this palatial hotel belongs, looks upon it as her “country-house,” and has furnished and decorated it with all the splendid and beautiful things that she has collected from all over the world....Next morning (December 14th) a cloudless sky and radiant sunshine revealed fresh beauties. The whole immense frontage of the hotel is occupied by a wide, raised stone veranda one mass of the most exquisite flowering creepers, gorgeous yellow alamandas, Cape Jasmine, Marshal-Niel roses, and every description of beautiful flowering shrub in the broad flower-bed that borders it, of which the hibiscus are especially beautiful, one mass of bloom, vivid scarlet and delicate rose-pink, and the “royal Poincianas,” of magnificent size and graceful beauty. From this immense veranda grand flights of steps descend into the garden and shrubberies, which are on the same gigantic and superb scale as the hotel, exquisitely laid out with fountains surrounded by beds of the rarest and most brilliant and beautiful flowers—every imaginable flowering shrub and plant—all carefully labelled with their botanical as well as more ordinary names, and the original habitat of each.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 241-3.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America; Caribbean; Gulf of Mexico,North America
Silver Springs,"Silver Springs, Florida",29.2159,-82.0534,Winifred Mary Howard,1895,"The far-famed Silver Springs! the “fountain of eternal youth,” sought for, far and wide, in vain, by the unhappy Ponce de Léon! These Springs, said to have been the fabled, “youth-renewing fountain” of Indian tradition are unutterably beautiful! a large and wide nearly circular basin, several acres in extent, is surrounded by low white rocks covered with lichen and moss of a deep rich velvety green, beyond which rise brilliant masses of feathery poplars of every shade of vivid gold and tender rose; and a background of tall shadowy cypresses, all closely veiled and shrouded in silvery moss, endless rows of spectral phantoms guarding the wells; the water itself, a miracle of beauty—smooth as a polished mirror, clear as crystal, its glassy, sheeny surface ever-changing from subtle tint to tint—tints for which there are no words; so delicately and insensibly, like strains of music almost too fine for human ear, playing from etherealized greens of every exquisite shade to gold, with heavenly notes of bright blue, and glittering silver, and rich, broad bands of glorious purple, shading to crimson and orange; and all this radiant sumptuousness of crystal unutterable colour so infinitely and luminously transparent, that, from the edge of the rocks, you gaze down, sixty feet deep, and see distinctly, through tremulously waving rays of light, the silvery sandy floor covered with little pearly shells, and myriads of darting fishes, and green-gold delicate waving grasses—all weaving and blending into more and more exquisite harmonies of prismatic lovely colour and shine. It seems a desecration, but you get into a little boat, and glide over the wonderful expanse, and see the silvery fountains bubbling up, and at the centre, gaze down fathomless depths, into a fearful chasm betwixt two snow-white chains of rock, rifted violently asunder, so limpidly clear the crystal element, that you feel the boat should sink down, and down, there being, apparently, nothing tangible for it to float on! Several times a week, rushes into this ideal fairy-pool, a fussing little steamer of strange unwieldy shape, beating and stirring the silver surface with noisy, irreverent screw; and a mill dares to make use of the glassy water, and profane swimmers plunge into its ice-cold depths—but nothing makes less the ever-serene and pellucid beauty of this marvellous magic mirror.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 249-51.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America; Caribbean; Gulf of Mexico,North America

Its east end is “Battery,” a grand esplanade 500 yards long, which commands a magnificient view of the extensive harbour and shipping, and the opposite “South Battery,” and Forts Sumter and Moultrie and sundry small islands—the scene of the first conflict of the Federals and Confederates (March 4th, 1861). South Carolina (so-called after Charles II.) which, even so far back as 1832, had declared for complete independence and autonomy of each separate state, was the first, in virtue of the “States'-rights doctrine,” to pass an ordinance of secession on December 20th, 1860, an example which was followed by the six other “Cotton States” in the following February....Next morning, December 24th, I started early to see the famous Gardens of Magnolia on the river Ashley, which in the spring must be perfectly lovely; full of the most superb tree azaleas, many of them 30 feet high, and huge japonicas and magnolias. Then back to the city, down Meeting Street, in which are the principal churches—the public buildings being mostly in the prettily-planted square close by, the centre of which is occupied by a statue of William Pitt (afterwards Earl of Chatham), erected in 1770, in gratitude for his great services to America in driving the French out of Canada, and his constant efforts and protestations, after his resignation of office in 1761, against the arbitrary policy of George III. towards colonial America; and in particular the repeal of the obnoxious Stamp Act in 1766 through his influence—as well as his eloquent and untiring denunciations, after his final resignation in 1768, of the aggravated persistence in that fatal policy.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 262-4.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The road more and more icy and slippery as we rose into the snowy hearts of the hills, passing lovely sheltered hollows and plantations of every variety of rare and beautiful fir and pine. For miles through the admirably-kept estate of Biltmore, which looks like one vast pleasure-ground—a picturesque occasional cottage and trim little garden. At last the mountains opened into a vast expanse of smiling valley bathed in sunshine, itself exquisitely undulating, and we reached the extraordinarily grand and beautiful site on which Mr. George Vanderbilt has built his magnificent country house. It is a site perfect and unique in its delicate and in finitely poetic beauty. The entire environings—especially as seen from the point of view of a graceful white marble kiosk at the further extremity of the beautiful green lawn adjoining the chateau—indescribably lovely and superbly stately. It is a place where only old-world minuets should be danced and poetry spoken! No profane noises should be allowed to mar the infinite sense of sublime, reposeful peace, and dreamy, poetic harmony! You see before you a sunshiny arcadian valley, serene and smiling, of grand and majestic width and limitless length; its far western horizon guarded by endless blue lovely chains of hills and snow-crowned peaks, stretching from far south to north, as far as eye can reach, into dimmest distance, melting and vanishing into misty, vapoury, vague mystery that might be sunlit sea or sky. Eastward rise beautifully wooded hills, and in the far north, snowy peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains, the sun-bathed valley restfully shining between in the golden light. The house itself is an immense and handsome castellated palace. Its west front stands sheer up on the very edge of a high, bold, rocky bluff, rising perpendicularly, with very fine effect, from the green vale. On the entrance side, facing east, a wide terrace stretches to the foot of a high, white marble wall and sculptured balustrade, in front of which a, triple fountain plays out of exquisitely carved white marble basins, on each side of which grand flights of wide white marble steps ascend to a beautiful terraced Italian garden, beyond which a gentle acclivity of exquisitely green turf, worthy of England, leads to the wooded heights above. The vista, from this terrace, of chateau, valley, and distant hills, is superb, but the loveliest point of view is the one I have already described.","Winifred Mary Howard, Journal of a Tour in the United States, Canada and Mexico (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1897), 278-80.",https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/03997/03997.pdf,United States of America,Northern America,North America

The approach to this harbour is long and circuitous, for a vessel has to wind hither and thither to avoid shoals; and as the channel is ill-buoyed, careful captains sometimes wait for the tide to be at least half full before they cross the shallowest part, where there may be only twenty feet of water at low tide. Within the harbour there is plenty of good deep anchorage opposite the town, and a still more sheltered spot is found a little farther up the inlet in a sort of lagoon. The town, which is growing fast, but still in a rough and unsightly condition, runs for half a mile along the bay front, while behind a suburb is built up the slope of a hill facing to the west. The site looks healthy enough, though it would have been better to plant the houses nearer to the high point which shields the anchorage. But behind the town to the east and north there are large swamps, reeking with malaria; and the residents have, therefore, though of course much less in the dry season, to be on their guard against fever, which, indeed, few who remain for a twelvemonth escape. The Portuguese Government is unfortunately hard pressed for money and has not been able to complete the projected quays, nor even to provide a custom-house and warehouses fit to receive and store the goods intended for the Transvaal, which are now discharged here in large quantities.

TOOTAHAH,Tahiti,-17.64859937,-149.4195244,James Cook,1769,"As we were returning to the boat, however, we were entertained with a sight that in some measure compensated for our fatigue and disappointment. In our way we came to one of the few places where access to the island is not guarded by a reef, and, consequently, a high surf breaks upon the shore; a more dreadful one, indeed, I had seldom seen; it was impossible for any European boat to have lived in it; and if the best swimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been exposed to its fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to preserve himself from drowning, especially as the shore was covered with pebbles and large stones; yet, in the midst of these breakers, were ten or twelve Indians swimming for their amusement: whenever a surf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all appearance with infinite facility, rose again on the other side. This diversion was greatly improved by the stern of an old canoe, which they happened to find upon the spot: they took this before them, and swam out with it as far as the outermost breach, then two or three of them getting into it, and turning the square end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the shore with incredible rapidity, sometimes almost to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way, in which case they dived, and rose on the other side with the canoe in their 138hands: they then swam out with it again, and were again driven back, just as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich-park for the pleasure of rolling down it. At this wonderful scene we stood gazing for more than half an hour, during which time none of the swimmers attempted to come on shore, but seemed to enjoy their sport in the highest degree; we then proceeded in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort.","The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Three Voyages of Captain Cook Round the World.
